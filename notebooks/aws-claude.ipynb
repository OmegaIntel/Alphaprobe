Demand from the finance and insurance sector, which is among the industry's largest downstream markets, will continue to expand over the next five years in line with improving macroeconomic conditions. The percentage of services conducted online is expected to continue hiking over the next five years. As more business operations are conducted online or through the cloud network, service demand will also increase.\\n\\nThe industry structure will keep on transforming.
