The population's medical needs are expanding the oldest demographic's consumption of medical services. At the same time, growing incomes and broader insurance coverage facilitate access to healthcare providers. Increasing healthcare spending was abruptly disrupted by the pandemic, exposing healthcare and social assistance providers to unprecedented financial and operational pressures.

Persistent labor shortages jeopardize healthcare and social assistance providers' ability to address demand, creating widespread staff burnout and high turnover rates. These shortages have fueled wage inflation in the sector and the use of costlier contract labor, squeezing profit.

However, increasing demand and elevated costs will pressure healthcare and social assistance providers to shift how they operate. Consolidation activity will ramp up as smaller providers join larger health groups to secure larger insurer reimbursements. Digital tools and telehealth will continue to be integrated into healthcare delivery because they can lower costs, increase capacity and enable access to patients in underserved areas.
