Changes in these reimbursements (determined by various competing factors) can occur annually and produce significant consequences for healthcare and social assistance facilities.\\\\n\\\\n- How public and private payors pay healthcare facilities for services differs. Prices paid by commercial insurers are determined by negotiations, whereas laws and regulations mandate costs for public insurers.

A drop-off in funding in 2022 strained providers as costs continued rising.\\\\n\\\\n- The pandemic\\'s aftermath continues to have a more acute effect on some healthcare providers. Hospitals, daycare centers, mental health and substance abuse centers garner less profit than other providers.\\\\n\\\\n- High inflation, rising wages and increasing operating costs will continue to pressure profit in 2024. While inflation is expected to cool through the year, healthcare providers will still have to manage securing reimbursements that offset higher prices to limit inflation\\'s impact on profit.\\\\n\", \"\\\\n# Healthcare and Social Assistance in the US\\\\n## Performance\\\\n### What influences industry volatility?\\\\n#### Healthcare services are vital to public health\\\\n\\\\n- Healthcare and social assistance facilities provide services that are essential to overall public health.\\\\n\\\\n- Medical treatment doesn\\'t have any substitutes. While consumers can cut back on elective procedures when spending tightens, people can\\'t avoid medical services entirely.\\\\n\\\\n- A wide breadth of factors determines the prevalence of illness, injury and mental illness. External events, like the pandemic, can exacerbate physical and mental illness rates. The increasingly complex health needs of the subset of the US population that is of advanced age contribute to higher healthcare consumption.\\\\n\\\\n- Social assistance providers have a crucial role in promoting the well-being of individuals and communities but are simultaneously sensitive to changes in funding levels.

Medicaid is the second-largest payer of health services in the US – and these reimbursements make up a significantly larger share of sector revenue than Medicare reimbursements.\\\\n\\\\n35# IBISWorld | Healthcare and Social Assistance in the US Mar 2024\\\\n\\\\n- Medicare and Medicaid funding jumped following the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, as extended enrollment periods absorbed private insurance losses.\\\\n\\\\n- Higher Medicaid funding and enrollment continued throughout the pandemic, leading healthcare and social assistance facilities to receive larger shares of revenue from Medicaid reimbursements. Higher enrollment stemmed from the Families First Coronavirus Response Act of 2020, which mandated continuous coverage through March 31, 2023.\\\\n\\\\n- Medicaid reimbursements are expected to have accounted for less sector revenue in 2023. Congress\\' spending plan for 2023 allowed states to continue disenrollment in April of that year, and the Kaiser Family Foundation reported that more than 5.5 million enrollees lost coverage as of August 2023.\\\\n\\\\n- Yet Medicare will experience the fastest growth moving forward, as this segment will have the highest enrollment growth as the over 65 population advances further in age.\\\\n\", \"\\\\n# Healthcare and Social Assistance in the US\\\\n## External Environment\\\\n### External Drivers\\\\n#### What demographic and macroeconomic factors impact the industry?\\\\n##### Federal funding for Medicare and Medicaid\\\\n### Growth\\\\n\\\\nThe image displays a bar chart showing the growth trends in federal funding for Medicare and Medicaid from 2013 to 2028, with projections up to 2028.

The growth rates appear to level off in the projected years of 2025 and 2028, showing moderate positive growth.\\\\n\\\\nThis chart suggests cyclical patterns in federal funding growth for Medicare and Medicaid, with periods of high growth followed by contractions, and a projected stabilization in the future.\\\\n\\\\nSource: IBISWorld\\\\n\\\\nReimbursements from Medicaid and Medicare are a major source of revenue for healthcare providers, while Medicaid and Medicare coverage (and the extent of their benefits) determine access to healthcare services for many citizens. Higher coverage rates lower out-of-pocket costs for patients, increasing access to healthcare services.\\\\n\\\\nTotal health expenditure measures public and private spending on services and activities that promote health and prevent disease, including physicians and other medical professionals, home healthcare agencies, nursing homes, hospitals and health insurers. Changes in health expenditure directly influence revenue for healthcare and social assistance providers.\\\\n\\\\nAdults 65 and older spend more on healthcare services than any other age group, an outcome of an inherently higher incidence of chronic illness and injury. This population subset\\'s expanding medical needs are a main driver behind rising healthcare spending, as this age group requires more frequent, high-cost services.\\\\n\\\\n68# IBISWorld | Healthcare and Social Assistance in the US Mar 2024\\\\n\", \"\\\\n# Healthcare and Social Assistance in the US\\\\n## Products and Markets\\\\n### Major Markets\\\\n#### What\\'s influencing demand from the industry\\'s markets?\\\\n##### Private insurers are the largest payer to healthcare and social assistance providers\\\\n\\\\n- Reimbursements from private payors include payments received from commercial health plans. Private insurers reimburse in-network providers for patient treatment; contract negotiations between payors and providers determine prices. Revenue received from private payor reimbursements has stagnated in recent years.\\\\n\\\\n- A spike in the unemployment rate during the COVID-19 pandemic led to a drop-off in private health coverage, reducing private insurance payments to providers. Higher service utilization and increased enrollment in 2021 led to an uptick, but the share of total private reimbursements remained below the pre-COVID total in 2023.\\\\n\"]',\n",
