Both the 2017 and 2022 versions of NAICS assign the code 62 to this sector, indicating consistency in classification over time.\\\\n\\\\n## Definition\\\\n\\\\nThe Healthcare and Social Assistance sector is composed of enterprises that provide healthcare and social assistance for individuals in the United States, including hospitals, ambulatory service providers and nursing and residential care facilities. Social assistance also includes counselors and social workers, family and welfare services and natural disaster and emergency relief services.\\\\n\\\\n## Related Terms\\\\n\\\\n### ELECTRONIC HEALTH RECORD (EHR)\\\\n\\\\nThe systematic collection and maintenance of electronic health information about an individual patient.\\\\n\\\\n### TELEMEDICINE\\\\n\\\\nAn application of clinical medicine whereby medical information is transferred through interactive audiovisual media for the purpose of consulting and remote medical procedures or examinations.\\\\n\\\\n### HEALTH INSURANCE EXCHANGE\\\\n\\\\nA set of state-regulated and standardized healthcare plans from which individuals may purchase health insurance eligible for federal subsidies.\\\\n\\\\n### FEE-FOR-SERVICE\\\\n\\\\nA health plan where individuals choose the doctor, hospital or clinic and the insurance pays for part or all of the cost according to a schedule laid out in the policy.\\\\n\\\\n### MEDICARE AND MEDICAID\\\\n\\\\nCost-coverage programs. Medicare pays all or part of a stay following hospitalization of at least three days; Medicaid covers a stay of any length for individuals who meet income requirements.\\\\n\\\\n### LONG-TERM CARE\\\\n\\\\nTreatment for a chronic condition, trauma, or illness that limits a person\\'s ability to carry out basic self-care tasks, called activities of daily living (ADLs).\\\\n\\\\n### FEDERAL EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT AGENCY (FEMA)\\\\n\\\\nA federal agency designed to prepare for, mitigate against, respond to and help individuals and communities recover from natural and man-made disasters.\", \\'# IBISWorld | Healthcare and Social Assistance in the US\\\\n\\\\n## Market Share\\\\n\\\\n### Healthcare and Social Assistance in the US\\\\n\\\\n#### Industry Market Share by Company\\\\nIndustry-specific company revenue as a share of total industry revenue\\\\n\\\\nThe image displays a bar chart representing the market share distribution in the Healthcare and Social Assistance industry in the US. The chart is predominantly filled with a light blue area labeled \"Other Companies (98%)\". This indicates that the vast majority of the market, 98%, is composed of numerous smaller companies or entities that individually do not hold significant market share.\\\\n\\\\nA thin dark blue bar on the far right of the chart represents the remaining 2% of the market. While not explicitly labeled, this likely represents one or more larger companies that have a slightly more substantial, but still relatively small, share of the market.\\\\n\\\\nThis chart suggests a highly fragmented industry where no single company or small group of companies dominates the market. The healthcare and social assistance sector in the US appears to be characterized by a multitude of smaller providers rather than a few large, dominant players.\\\\n\\\\nSource: IBISWorld\\\\n\\\\nChart displays current year only in the PDF version of this report.

The chart is divided into four segments, each representing a different sector of the industry:\\\\n\\\\n1. Hospitals ($1.5tr): This segment occupies the largest portion of the chart, accounting for 41.7% of the industry revenue.\\\\n\\\\n2. Ambulatory healthcare services ($1.4tr): The second-largest segment, representing 40.7% of the industry revenue.\\\\n\\\\n3. Nursing homes and residential facilities ($330.6bn): This segment accounts for 9.3% of the industry revenue.\\\\n\\\\n4. Social assistance ($295.1bn): The smallest segment, making up 8.3% of the industry revenue.\\\\n\\\\nThe chart provides a clear visualization of the relative sizes of each sector within the healthcare and social assistance industry. Hospitals and ambulatory healthcare services dominate the industry, collectively accounting for over 82% of the total revenue. Nursing homes and residential facilities, along with social assistance, make up the remaining 17.6% of the industry revenue.\\\\n\\\\nThis segmentation offers insights into the structure of the US healthcare and social assistance industry, highlighting the significant role of hospitals and ambulatory services in generating revenue, while also showing the smaller but still substantial contributions of nursing homes and social assistance services.\\\\n\\\\nSource: IBISWorld\\']',\n",
