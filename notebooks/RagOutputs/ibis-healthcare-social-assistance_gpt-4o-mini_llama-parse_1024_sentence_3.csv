Social assistance providers have had an outsized role in addressing these inequities since the COVID-19 pandemic subsided.\n- Pandemic relief funding that cushioned savings accounts and lifted many out of poverty ended between 2022 and 2023, with exact end dates varying between states. As benefits disappeared, millions turned to social assistance providers for help with housing, food assistance and child care.\n- The end of pandemic food assistance benefits coupled with rising inflation have made affording the cost of essentials like groceries too expensive for many. Food banks nationwide have reported record need for their services, squeezing their staff and supplies thin.\n- Day Care (62441) providers are vital to addressing critical shortages of child care, especially as parents return to in-office work.

A CON is a state-level regulatory mechanism for healthcare facilities that determines the public need for a new facility or service. Oversight via CON ensures health delivery services align with community needs to prevent heightened healthcare costs. Violations of the CON requirement can result in civil sanctions or revocation of a facility's license.\n\n# Antikickback Statute and Physician Self-Referral Laws\n\nThe federal Antikickback Statute prohibits the exchange of anything of value (financial incentives, low rents, excessive compensation) to incentivize the referral of business that's reimbursable by federal healthcare programs. Kickbacks promote overutilization of healthcare costs and corrupt decision-making by steering patients away from other services. The Physician Self-Referral Law, also known as the Stark Law, prohibits physicians from referring patients to a healthcare service if they or a family member have a financial relationship with that entity.\n\n# Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act\n\nAll healthcare providers, including mental health and substance abuse clinics, must comply with the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA). The HIPAA criteria outline controls the use of patient health data by any healthcare provider that stores, shares or sends private patient data.\n\n# The HITECH Act\n\nThe Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health (HITECH) Act mandates audits of healthcare providers to ensure they comply with HIPAA. The HITECH Act strengthens HIPAA by incentivizing providers to adopt electronic health records (EHR) and enforcing steeper penalties for noncompliance.\n\n# The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services provisions\n\nThe Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) makes payments to participating healthcare providers under its Medicare and Medicaid programs based on various formulas. Federal law mandates that services hospitals render to Medicare and Medicaid patients meet professionally recognized standards. In addition, CMS provisions ensure that the healthcare services are medically necessary and reimbursement claims are correctly filed.\n\n# The No Surprises Act\n\nThe No Surprises Act (NSA) established new federal protections against surprise medical bills. The NSA bans surprise bills for most emergency services, nonemergency services from out-of-network providers at in-network facilities and services from out-of-network air ambulance service providers. The new protections went into effect on January 1, 2022."", ""# Healthcare and Social Assistance in the US\n\n# Assistance\n\n# What assistance is available to this industry?\n\n# The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services\n\nThe Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) manages reimbursements for patients' healthcare services at a healthcare facility. Various provisions determine CMS reimbursements, which change based on location and designation. Reimbursements generally vary annually based on CMS' Physicians Fee Schedule.\n\n# COVID-19 response\n\nHealthcare facilities were primary recipients of federal support programs during COVID-19 in response to their vital role in combatting it. Facilities were allocated over $100.0 billion from the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security (CARES) Act and $75.0 billion from the Paycheck Protection Program. The Provider Relief Fund, the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) and the American Rescue Plan also allocated billions in funding.\n\n# Federal initiatives\n\nThe federal government is a significant funding source for healthcare facilities through direct funding or funding that promotes access. Recent examples include the Biden Administration's use of federal courts and health programs to expand the use of medication to treat substance use disorders in pregnant women or expansion to Medicare and Medicaid programs.\n\n# The American Hospital Association\n\nThe American Hospital Association (AHA) is a national organization representing all types of hospitals, healthcare networks, patients and communities. The AHA comprises over 5,000 hospitals, health care systems, networks and 43,000 individual members.\n\n# Industry organizations\n\nAn organization represents nearly every industry operating as a healthcare or social assistance facility. Industry organizations are businesses or individuals in a specific industry joined together to promote, advocate, lobby and set standards for members. Examples include the American Dental Association, the American Psychiatric Association and the American Optometric Association.""]"

What are the primary challenges facing healthcare and social assistance providers in the US?,"The primary challenges include unprecedented challenges created by COVID-19, staffing shortages, rising costs, and the need to cater to the expanding and complex medical needs of older adults.",text,other,9,62 Healthcare and Social Assistance in the US Industry Report.pdf,Understanding key challenges helps in assessing risks and opportunities in the industry.,"Healthcare and social assistance providers in the US are facing several primary challenges. These include persistent workforce shortages, particularly among nursing staff, as many healthcare workers have left the field due to burnout and better-paying opportunities. Additionally, rising costs for medical supplies, devices, and pharmaceuticals are straining financial resources, while government reimbursements have not kept pace with these increased expenses. The end of pandemic relief funding has further complicated the financial landscape for many providers, leading to difficulties in maintaining profitability. Lastly, the ongoing consolidation trends in the industry are pushing smaller, independent practices to seek affiliation with larger health systems to enhance their negotiating power with insurers.","[21, 20, 26]","['# IBISWorld | Healthcare and Social Assistance in the US\n\n# Mar 2024\n\n- The dramatic rise in the adoption of telemedicine in 2020 has fallen from its pandemic high but is still more integral to healthcare delivery in 2024 than pre-COVID, especially for providers offering mental health treatment.\n- The challenges impacting healthcare providers are also expediting the adoption of other digital tools (AI, patient engagement products, data analytics) to streamline operations and produce cost savings.\n\n# Social assistance providers fill in the gaps as pandemic-era benefits end\n\n- The pandemic highlighted societal inequities. Social assistance providers have had an outsized role in addressing these inequities since the COVID-19 pandemic subsided.\n- Pandemic relief funding that cushioned savings accounts and lifted many out of poverty ended between 2022 and 2023, with exact end dates varying between states. As benefits disappeared, millions turned to social assistance providers for help with housing, food assistance and child care.\n- The end of pandemic food assistance benefits coupled with rising inflation have made affording the cost of essentials like groceries too expensive for many. Food banks nationwide have reported record need for their services, squeezing their staff and supplies thin.\n- Day Care (62441) providers are vital to addressing critical shortages of child care, especially as parents return to in-office work. The industry has struggled to recover from the pandemic as it attempts to meet excess demand, with the end of funding in late 2023 only exacerbating staffing issues, tight margins and steep fees.', ""# IBISWorld | Healthcare and Social Assistance in the US\n\n# Mar 2024\n\n# Current Performance\n\n# What's driving current industry performance?\n\n# Demographic trends shape the healthcare landscape\n\n- Economic and demographic forces have fueled rising spending on healthcare and social assistance services in recent years.\n- The older population's expanding medical needs as they age are the primary force behind higher healthcare spending. The older demographic is linked explicitly to robust growth in areas like Elderly and Disabled Person Services (IBISWorld report 62412), Nursing Care Facilities (62311) and Assisted Living Facilities (OD6231).\n- Broader insurance coverage has also facilitated access to healthcare services. Higher enrollment in public insurance offset the pandemic-related drop-off in private insurance coverage. Still, the end of the continuous coverage requirement in March 2023 has allowed states to resume Medicaid terminations, resulting in consumer losses of Medicaid coverage since.\n\n# Healthcare providers grapple with persistent workforce shortages\n\n- COVID-19 exacerbated labor shortages that had existed prior to the onset of the pandemic. A large population that is over 65, low reimbursement rates and a retirement cliff fueled initial shortages. In 2024, healthcare facilities are struggling to attract and retain employees from a smaller employee pool as burnt-out healthcare staff quit, retire or jump to higher-paying positions.\n- Nursing shortages have been straining healthcare providers the most, and the American Hospital Association has reported that more than 100,000 registered nurses left the workforce between 2021 and 2023. The challenges that are driving these shortages remain, as reflected through the multiple nursing strikes in 2023, keeping expenses for these employees high.\n- While hiring challenges will weigh heavily on healthcare providers through 2024, other cost pressures will also strain their financial health. Rising prices for everything from devices to consumables and pharmaceuticals will eat at their bottom lines. Government reimbursements haven’t grown fast enough to cover these elevated costs, with providers’ ability to negotiate higher payments from private insurers left to determine their performance.\n- Federal relief lessened the blow of higher costs and low patient volumes between 2020 and 2021. The Provider Relief Fund, for instance, allocated $178.0 billion to bolster hospitals and other healthcare providers during the pandemic. Funding dissolved in 2022 for most healthcare and social assistance providers, leaving many providers struggling to stay profitable since.\n\n# The pandemic accelerated existing consolidation trends in healthcare\n\n- Larger health systems eye acquisitions to create economies of scale, lower costs and gain negotiating power. The pandemic accelerated the rising consolidation activity that had been occurring in recent years.\n- Private and public insurers only partially cover the cost of delivering healthcare, incentivizing healthcare providers to acquire an upper hand in provider-payer negotiations. Independent (often small or rural) practices risking service eliminations or closure have been targets of acquisitions."", '# IBISWorld | Healthcare and Social Assistance in the US\n\n# Mar 2024\n\nwillingness to participate.\n\n- Many healthcare and social assistance entities will adopt digital and telehealth tools to bridge the gap between urban and rural communities regarding healthcare access. Grants awarded by the Biden Administration will help rural healthcare organizations expand critical services through digital tools.\n- Tech advances to address the widening needs of people of advanced age, like home health tools and remote monitoring equipment, will also become paramount. Instantaneous access to medical data through cloud infrastructure will also have a massive role in providing care for this population subset as medical needs mount.\n\n# Financial pressures will accelerate consolidation activity\n\n- The consolidation activity that defines the health sector will continue despite an economic environment of higher interest rates.\n- Mounting healthcare costs and reimbursement cuts will incentivize smaller, independent healthcare providers to join larger health groups. Larger health systems gain negotiating power with insurance providers to secure better rates.\n- Private equity (PE) investment will also be present in healthcare. Significant growth opportunities, in areas ranging from physical therapy and mental health to nursing and residential care, attract PE investment.']"

Private insurers reimburse in-network providers for patient treatment; contract negotiations between payors and providers determine prices. Revenue received from private payor reimbursements has stagnated in recent years.\n- A spike in the unemployment rate during the COVID-19 pandemic led to a drop-off in private health coverage, reducing private insurance payments to providers. Higher service utilization and increased enrollment in 2021 led to an uptick, but the share of total private reimbursements remained below the pre-COVID total in 2023.\n\n# Public insurers pay more as older adults age\n\n- Government revenue sources include reimbursements from Medicaid and Medicare and grants or loans from federal or state agencies. Medicaid is the second-largest payer of health services in the US – and these reimbursements make up a significantly larger share of sector revenue than Medicare reimbursements.\n\n35']"

Providers will continue to contend with the drop-offs in federal programs related to COVID-19, but demographic and economic forces will persist in driving healthcare consumption.\n- Healthcare and social assistance providers will be increasingly vital in meeting the complex medical and social needs of people of advanced age, which make up a sizeable subset of the US population.\n- As Medicare enrollment expands, healthcare providers will become more reliant on those reimbursements as a revenue source. Still, private insurers will remain the top payer.\n\nThe pandemic’s long-term effects are emerging\n\n- This sector suffers from staffing shortages that predate the COVID-19 pandemic and became exacerbated by it. Labor shortages and employee burnout will continue challenging healthcare and social assistance providers.\n- Healthcare providers across the sector will grapple with steeper costs for everything from medical supplies to pharmaceuticals and staff. While many trends that initially drove up these costs will settle, that won’t necessarily translate to lower prices. Securing reimbursements from insurers that cover these higher costs will become even more critical for healthcare providers to maintain profit.\n- The pandemic accelerated the shift in healthcare delivery. Hospitals will stay the central focus in the health sector, but other care sites (ambulatory surgery centers, urgent care centers) will continue to see rising patient volumes. Ambulatory surgery centers’ focus on cost savings and convenience will contribute to their growing popularity.\n- The steadying patient volumes that followed the initial surge in people seeking healthcare treatments as the pandemic subsided won’t be felt by all healthcare providers. The pandemic's long-term toll on mental health will continue to be acutely felt by mental health and substance abuse centers and clinics.\n\nTech advances will reshape healthcare delivery\n\n- Tech advances can potentially transform every aspect of healthcare and social assistance delivery, but navigating tech investments, evolving regulations and cybersecurity will pose challenges. For example, providers will hasten their adoption of digital tools, but higher capital costs could slow the pace of a digital transformation for many. Healthcare providers can also expect the regulatory landscape regarding data privacy and security to intensify as more medical data goes digital.\n- While telemedicine’s ability to address physician shortages and lower costs will be invaluable, its utilization by patients and providers will depend on how the regulatory environment surrounding it evolves.

Staffing shortages and rising costs continue to impact providers and businesses.,text,other,15,62 Healthcare and Social Assistance in the US Industry Report.pdf,Understanding major challenges helps in assessing risks and opportunities in the industry.,"Healthcare and social assistance providers in the US are facing several significant challenges:

1. **Workforce Shortages**: There is a persistent shortage of healthcare workers, particularly nurses, exacerbated by burnout and high turnover rates. Many healthcare staff have left the workforce, and attracting new employees from a limited pool remains difficult.

2. **Rising Costs**: Providers are grappling with increasing prices for medical supplies, pharmaceuticals, and other operational costs. Government reimbursements have not kept pace with these rising expenses, putting additional financial strain on providers.

3. **Impact of Pandemic Relief Funding**: The end of pandemic relief funding has left many providers struggling to maintain profitability. This funding had previously helped mitigate the financial impact of low patient volumes and high operational costs.

4. **Increased Demand for Services**: As pandemic-era benefits end, there is a growing demand for social assistance services, particularly in areas like housing, food assistance, and childcare. Providers are challenged to meet this rising demand while managing limited resources.

5. **Consolidation Pressures**: Smaller and independent practices are at risk of closure or service elimination, leading to increased consolidation as larger health systems acquire them to gain negotiating power and economies of scale.

6. **Economic Inequities**: The pandemic highlighted societal inequities, and social assistance providers are now tasked with addressing these gaps, which adds to their operational challenges.

These factors collectively create a complex environment for healthcare and social assistance providers, impacting their ability to deliver services effectively.","[21, 20, 13]","['# IBISWorld | Healthcare and Social Assistance in the US\n\n# Mar 2024\n\n- The dramatic rise in the adoption of telemedicine in 2020 has fallen from its pandemic high but is still more integral to healthcare delivery in 2024 than pre-COVID, especially for providers offering mental health treatment.\n- The challenges impacting healthcare providers are also expediting the adoption of other digital tools (AI, patient engagement products, data analytics) to streamline operations and produce cost savings.\n\n# Social assistance providers fill in the gaps as pandemic-era benefits end\n\n- The pandemic highlighted societal inequities. Social assistance providers have had an outsized role in addressing these inequities since the COVID-19 pandemic subsided.\n- Pandemic relief funding that cushioned savings accounts and lifted many out of poverty ended between 2022 and 2023, with exact end dates varying between states. As benefits disappeared, millions turned to social assistance providers for help with housing, food assistance and child care.\n- The end of pandemic food assistance benefits coupled with rising inflation have made affording the cost of essentials like groceries too expensive for many. Food banks nationwide have reported record need for their services, squeezing their staff and supplies thin.\n- Day Care (62441) providers are vital to addressing critical shortages of child care, especially as parents return to in-office work.

The population's medical needs are expanding the oldest demographic's consumption of medical services. At the same time, growing incomes and broader insurance coverage facilitate access to healthcare providers. Increasing healthcare spending was abruptly disrupted by the pandemic, exposing healthcare and social assistance providers to unprecedented financial and operational pressures. Though pandemic concerns have alleviated, the long-term effects of it continue to shape every corner of the health sector. Still, revenue has been expanding at a CAGR of 0.7% to an estimated $3.6 trillion over the past five years, with revenue rising an expected 0.3% in 2024.\n\nThe pandemic exacerbated existing staffing shortages. Persistent labor shortages jeopardize healthcare and social assistance providers' ability to address demand, creating widespread staff burnout and high turnover rates. These shortages have fueled wage inflation in the sector and the use of costlier contract labor, squeezing profit. Some areas of Healthcare and Social Assistance are facing more critical shortages, and the long-term effects of the pandemic continue to make it difficult for companies to attract and retain employees to fill these gaps.\n\nDemographic trends will continue to be the driving force behind rising healthcare spending moving forward. However, increasing demand and elevated costs will pressure healthcare and social assistance providers to shift how they operate. Consolidation activity will ramp up as smaller providers join larger health groups to secure larger insurer reimbursements. Digital tools and telehealth will continue to be integrated into healthcare delivery because they can lower costs, increase capacity and enable access to patients in underserved areas. In all, sector revenue will grow at a CAGR of 2.7% to an estimated $4.1 trillion in the coming years.""]"

The pandemic accelerated the rising consolidation activity that had been occurring in recent years.\n- Private and public insurers only partially cover the cost of delivering healthcare, incentivizing healthcare providers to acquire an upper hand in provider-payer negotiations. Independent (often small or rural) practices risking service eliminations or closure have been targets of acquisitions."", ""# IBISWorld | Healthcare and Social Assistance in the US\n\n# Mar 2024\n\n# Outlook\n\n↑ 2024-29 Revenue CAGR +2.7%\n\n# What's driving the industry outlook?\n\nDemographic trends are behind rising healthcare spending\n\n- Consumer spending on healthcare and social assistance services won't slow in the coming years. Providers will continue to contend with the drop-offs in federal programs related to COVID-19, but demographic and economic forces will persist in driving healthcare consumption.\n- Healthcare and social assistance providers will be increasingly vital in meeting the complex medical and social needs of people of advanced age, which make up a sizeable subset of the US population.\n- As Medicare enrollment expands, healthcare providers will become more reliant on those reimbursements as a revenue source. Still, private insurers will remain the top payer.\n\nThe pandemic’s long-term effects are emerging\n\n- This sector suffers from staffing shortages that predate the COVID-19 pandemic and became exacerbated by it. Labor shortages and employee burnout will continue challenging healthcare and social assistance providers.\n- Healthcare providers across the sector will grapple with steeper costs for everything from medical supplies to pharmaceuticals and staff. While many trends that initially drove up these costs will settle, that won’t necessarily translate to lower prices. Securing reimbursements from insurers that cover these higher costs will become even more critical for healthcare providers to maintain profit.\n- The pandemic accelerated the shift in healthcare delivery. Hospitals will stay the central focus in the health sector, but other care sites (ambulatory surgery centers, urgent care centers) will continue to see rising patient volumes. Ambulatory surgery centers’ focus on cost savings and convenience will contribute to their growing popularity.\n- The steadying patient volumes that followed the initial surge in people seeking healthcare treatments as the pandemic subsided won’t be felt by all healthcare providers. The pandemic's long-term toll on mental health will continue to be acutely felt by mental health and substance abuse centers and clinics.\n\nTech advances will reshape healthcare delivery\n\n- Tech advances can potentially transform every aspect of healthcare and social assistance delivery, but navigating tech investments, evolving regulations and cybersecurity will pose challenges. For example, providers will hasten their adoption of digital tools, but higher capital costs could slow the pace of a digital transformation for many. Healthcare providers can also expect the regulatory landscape regarding data privacy and security to intensify as more medical data goes digital.\n- While telemedicine’s ability to address physician shortages and lower costs will be invaluable, its utilization by patients and providers will depend on how the regulatory environment surrounding it evolves. For example, Medicare’s extension of telehealth flexibilities ends in December 2024; how Medicare adapts its telehealth policies for 2025 will determine patients’ access and providers’."", ""# Healthcare and Social Assistance in the US\n\n# SWOT\n\n|Strengths|Weaknesses|Opportunities|Threats|\n|---|---|---|---|\n|High Profit vs. Sector Average|Low Revenue per Employee|High Revenue Growth (2019-2024)|Low Revenue Growth (2005-2024)|\n|Low Customer Class Concentration|Low Product/Service Concentration|High Revenue Growth (2024-2029)|Low Outlier Number of people with private health insurance|\n|Low Capital Requirements| |Federal funding for Medicare and Medicaid| |\n\n# Executive Summary\n\nDemographic and economic factors are the driving forces behind rising healthcare spending in the US.

External events, like the pandemic, can exacerbate physical and mental illness rates. The increasingly complex health needs of the subset of the US population that is of advanced age contribute to higher healthcare consumption.\n- Social assistance providers have a crucial role in promoting the well-being of individuals and communities but are simultaneously sensitive to changes in funding levels.

Changes in these reimbursements (determined by various competing factors) can occur annually and produce significant consequences for healthcare and social assistance facilities.\n- How public and private payors pay healthcare facilities for services differs. Prices paid by commercial insurers are determined by negotiations, whereas laws and regulations mandate costs for public insurers.

A dizzying amount of federal, state and local laws apply in this sector, enforced by multiple agencies and regulators.\n- Healthcare providers received over $200.0 billion to ease pandemic-related financial and operational pressures.

The population's medical needs are expanding the oldest demographic's consumption of medical services. At the same time, growing incomes and broader insurance coverage facilitate access to healthcare providers. Increasing healthcare spending was abruptly disrupted by the pandemic, exposing healthcare and social assistance providers to unprecedented financial and operational pressures. Though pandemic concerns have alleviated, the long-term effects of it continue to shape every corner of the health sector. Still, revenue has been expanding at a CAGR of 0.7% to an estimated $3.6 trillion over the past five years, with revenue rising an expected 0.3% in 2024.\n\nThe pandemic exacerbated existing staffing shortages. Persistent labor shortages jeopardize healthcare and social assistance providers' ability to address demand, creating widespread staff burnout and high turnover rates. These shortages have fueled wage inflation in the sector and the use of costlier contract labor, squeezing profit. Some areas of Healthcare and Social Assistance are facing more critical shortages, and the long-term effects of the pandemic continue to make it difficult for companies to attract and retain employees to fill these gaps.\n\nDemographic trends will continue to be the driving force behind rising healthcare spending moving forward. However, increasing demand and elevated costs will pressure healthcare and social assistance providers to shift how they operate. Consolidation activity will ramp up as smaller providers join larger health groups to secure larger insurer reimbursements. Digital tools and telehealth will continue to be integrated into healthcare delivery because they can lower costs, increase capacity and enable access to patients in underserved areas. In all, sector revenue will grow at a CAGR of 2.7% to an estimated $4.1 trillion in the coming years.""]"

The reasons for shortages are complex, with the exact extent of shortages varying between settings.\n- The pandemic exacerbated labor shortages that had already existed in this sector. The mental and physical burden on healthcare workers led to burnout, inspiring many employees to quit, retire or change careers.\n- Shortages of new workers and a high turnover rate of existing workers have caused many providers to offer signing bonuses and additional bonuses to retain employees. Maintaining appropriate staffing levels is critical and required by law for many providers, so labor expenses must rise enough for providers to fill vacancies.\n- Many providers have been using contract labor to fill in the roster. Contracted staff come at a higher cost than salaried employees, although the cost for locum tenens (i.e. temporary fill-in) staffing has been settling from its peak in 2021.\n\n# Financial pressures erode profit for healthcare and social assistance providers\n\n- Margins vary based on location, type of facility and payer mix. Healthcare providers receiving most of their revenue from commercial insurers enjoy higher profit.\n- Billions in pandemic relief funding kept healthcare and social assistance providers profitable between 2020 and 2021. A drop-off in funding in 2022 strained providers as costs continued rising.\n- The pandemic's aftermath continues to have a more acute effect on some healthcare providers. Hospitals, daycare centers, mental health and substance abuse centers garner less profit than other providers.\n- High inflation, rising wages and increasing operating costs will continue to pressure profit in 2024. While inflation is expected to cool through the year, healthcare providers will still have to manage securing reimbursements that offset higher prices to limit inflation’s impact on profit.\n\n# Key Ratios\n\n|Year|Revenue per Employee ($)|Revenue per Enterprise ($ Million)|Employees per Estab.

This demographic shift is particularly linked to robust growth in services for the elderly and disabled, nursing care facilities, and assisted living facilities. Additionally, broader insurance coverage has improved access to healthcare services, although recent changes in Medicaid coverage have resulted in some consumer losses. Overall, the aging population and their increasing healthcare demands are significant factors influencing the industry.","[20, 13, 26]","[""# IBISWorld | Healthcare and Social Assistance in the US\n\n# Mar 2024\n\n# Current Performance\n\n# What's driving current industry performance?\n\n# Demographic trends shape the healthcare landscape\n\n- Economic and demographic forces have fueled rising spending on healthcare and social assistance services in recent years.\n- The older population's expanding medical needs as they age are the primary force behind higher healthcare spending. The older demographic is linked explicitly to robust growth in areas like Elderly and Disabled Person Services (IBISWorld report 62412), Nursing Care Facilities (62311) and Assisted Living Facilities (OD6231).\n- Broader insurance coverage has also facilitated access to healthcare services. Higher enrollment in public insurance offset the pandemic-related drop-off in private insurance coverage. Still, the end of the continuous coverage requirement in March 2023 has allowed states to resume Medicaid terminations, resulting in consumer losses of Medicaid coverage since.\n\n# Healthcare providers grapple with persistent workforce shortages\n\n- COVID-19 exacerbated labor shortages that had existed prior to the onset of the pandemic. A large population that is over 65, low reimbursement rates and a retirement cliff fueled initial shortages. In 2024, healthcare facilities are struggling to attract and retain employees from a smaller employee pool as burnt-out healthcare staff quit, retire or jump to higher-paying positions.\n- Nursing shortages have been straining healthcare providers the most, and the American Hospital Association has reported that more than 100,000 registered nurses left the workforce between 2021 and 2023. The challenges that are driving these shortages remain, as reflected through the multiple nursing strikes in 2023, keeping expenses for these employees high.\n- While hiring challenges will weigh heavily on healthcare providers through 2024, other cost pressures will also strain their financial health. Rising prices for everything from devices to consumables and pharmaceuticals will eat at their bottom lines. Government reimbursements haven’t grown fast enough to cover these elevated costs, with providers’ ability to negotiate higher payments from private insurers left to determine their performance.\n- Federal relief lessened the blow of higher costs and low patient volumes between 2020 and 2021. The Provider Relief Fund, for instance, allocated $178.0 billion to bolster hospitals and other healthcare providers during the pandemic. Funding dissolved in 2022 for most healthcare and social assistance providers, leaving many providers struggling to stay profitable since.\n\n# The pandemic accelerated existing consolidation trends in healthcare\n\n- Larger health systems eye acquisitions to create economies of scale, lower costs and gain negotiating power. The pandemic accelerated the rising consolidation activity that had been occurring in recent years.\n- Private and public insurers only partially cover the cost of delivering healthcare, incentivizing healthcare providers to acquire an upper hand in provider-payer negotiations. Independent (often small or rural) practices risking service eliminations or closure have been targets of acquisitions."", ""# Healthcare and Social Assistance in the US\n\n# SWOT\n\n|Strengths|Weaknesses|Opportunities|Threats|\n|---|---|---|---|\n|High Profit vs. Sector Average|Low Revenue per Employee|High Revenue Growth (2019-2024)|Low Revenue Growth (2005-2024)|\n|Low Customer Class Concentration|Low Product/Service Concentration|High Revenue Growth (2024-2029)|Low Outlier Number of people with private health insurance|\n|Low Capital Requirements| |Federal funding for Medicare and Medicaid| |\n\n# Executive Summary\n\nDemographic and economic factors are the driving forces behind rising healthcare spending in the US. The population's medical needs are expanding the oldest demographic's consumption of medical services. At the same time, growing incomes and broader insurance coverage facilitate access to healthcare providers. Increasing healthcare spending was abruptly disrupted by the pandemic, exposing healthcare and social assistance providers to unprecedented financial and operational pressures. Though pandemic concerns have alleviated, the long-term effects of it continue to shape every corner of the health sector. Still, revenue has been expanding at a CAGR of 0.7% to an estimated $3.6 trillion over the past five years, with revenue rising an expected 0.3% in 2024.\n\nThe pandemic exacerbated existing staffing shortages. Persistent labor shortages jeopardize healthcare and social assistance providers' ability to address demand, creating widespread staff burnout and high turnover rates. These shortages have fueled wage inflation in the sector and the use of costlier contract labor, squeezing profit. Some areas of Healthcare and Social Assistance are facing more critical shortages, and the long-term effects of the pandemic continue to make it difficult for companies to attract and retain employees to fill these gaps.\n\nDemographic trends will continue to be the driving force behind rising healthcare spending moving forward. However, increasing demand and elevated costs will pressure healthcare and social assistance providers to shift how they operate. Consolidation activity will ramp up as smaller providers join larger health groups to secure larger insurer reimbursements. Digital tools and telehealth will continue to be integrated into healthcare delivery because they can lower costs, increase capacity and enable access to patients in underserved areas. In all, sector revenue will grow at a CAGR of 2.7% to an estimated $4.1 trillion in the coming years."", '# IBISWorld | Healthcare and Social Assistance in the US\n\n# Mar 2024\n\nwillingness to participate.\n\n- Many healthcare and social assistance entities will adopt digital and telehealth tools to bridge the gap between urban and rural communities regarding healthcare access. Grants awarded by the Biden Administration will help rural healthcare organizations expand critical services through digital tools.\n- Tech advances to address the widening needs of people of advanced age, like home health tools and remote monitoring equipment, will also become paramount. Instantaneous access to medical data through cloud infrastructure will also have a massive role in providing care for this population subset as medical needs mount.\n\n# Financial pressures will accelerate consolidation activity\n\n- The consolidation activity that defines the health sector will continue despite an economic environment of higher interest rates.\n- Mounting healthcare costs and reimbursement cuts will incentivize smaller, independent healthcare providers to join larger health groups. Larger health systems gain negotiating power with insurance providers to secure better rates.\n- Private equity (PE) investment will also be present in healthcare. Significant growth opportunities, in areas ranging from physical therapy and mental health to nursing and residential care, attract PE investment.']"

To address staffing challenges, many providers are offering signing bonuses and additional incentives to retain employees. Additionally, the reliance on contract labor has increased, although this comes at a higher cost compared to salaried staff. Maintaining adequate staffing levels is crucial for compliance with legal requirements, further driving up labor expenses.","[74, 34, 48]","[""# IBISWorld | Healthcare and Social Assistance in the US\n\n# Mar 2024\n\nChart displays current year only in the PDF version of this report. You can view and download chart for all other years associated with this industry on my.ibisworld.com.\n\n# What trends impact industry costs?\n\n# Healthcare providers confront the exodus of workers\n\n- Labor shortages that characterize the health sector have been driving wage growth. The reasons for shortages are complex, with the exact extent of shortages varying between settings.\n- The pandemic exacerbated labor shortages that had already existed in this sector. The mental and physical burden on healthcare workers led to burnout, inspiring many employees to quit, retire or change careers.\n- Shortages of new workers and a high turnover rate of existing workers have caused many providers to offer signing bonuses and additional bonuses to retain employees. Maintaining appropriate staffing levels is critical and required by law for many providers, so labor expenses must rise enough for providers to fill vacancies.\n- Many providers have been using contract labor to fill in the roster. Contracted staff come at a higher cost than salaried employees, although the cost for locum tenens (i.e. temporary fill-in) staffing has been settling from its peak in 2021.\n\n# Financial pressures erode profit for healthcare and social assistance providers\n\n- Margins vary based on location, type of facility and payer mix. Healthcare providers receiving most of their revenue from commercial insurers enjoy higher profit.\n- Billions in pandemic relief funding kept healthcare and social assistance providers profitable between 2020 and 2021. A drop-off in funding in 2022 strained providers as costs continued rising.\n- The pandemic's aftermath continues to have a more acute effect on some healthcare providers. Hospitals, daycare centers, mental health and substance abuse centers garner less profit than other providers.\n- High inflation, rising wages and increasing operating costs will continue to pressure profit in 2024. While inflation is expected to cool through the year, healthcare providers will still have to manage securing reimbursements that offset higher prices to limit inflation’s impact on profit.\n\n# Key Ratios\n\n|Year|Revenue per Employee ($)|Revenue per Enterprise ($ Million)|Employees per Estab.

What consolidation trends are occurring in the US healthcare industry?,"Larger health systems are eyeing acquisitions to create economies of scale, lower costs and gain negotiating power. The pandemic accelerated the rising consolidation activity that had been occurring in recent years. Independent (often small or rural) practices risking service eliminations or closure have been targets of acquisitions.",text,other,20,62 Healthcare and Social Assistance in the US Industry Report.pdf,Understanding consolidation trends is essential for assessing market competition and industry structure.,"Consolidation in the US healthcare industry is characterized by an accelerated trend of mergers and acquisitions, driven by various factors including private equity involvement, rising healthcare costs, and reimbursement cuts. Smaller, independent healthcare providers are increasingly joining larger health systems to enhance their negotiating power with insurance providers and to achieve economies of scale. This consolidation is further influenced by a complex regulatory environment, which, while keeping overall market concentration low, creates barriers to entry and expansion for new entrants. Additionally, the shift towards integrated health systems is reshaping how care is delivered, with patients increasingly receiving services from interconnected networks of healthcare organizations.","[52, 47, 26]","['# IBISWorld | Healthcare and Social Assistance in the US\n\n# Mar 2024\n\n# 7.

Patients increasingly receive care from integrated health systems, an interconnected network of healthcare services and organizations.\n- Private equity's increasing involvement in the health sector has also transformed the sector's makeup. Private equity has brought about a rise in mergers and acquisitions and a consolidation of healthcare entities. A convergence of factors is fueling M&A activity: changing regulatory, tech and market dynamics have encouraged M&A as a way to create scale and reduce costs.\n\n# The regulatory environment keeps concentration low\n\n- Certificate of Need (CON) laws inhibit expansion – 36 states enforce CON laws. These laws require most healthcare facilities to demonstrate the public need for a facility expansion, service addition or medical equipment purchase before implementation. Consequently, they also create barriers to entry and expansion, impeding a company's ability to grow.\n- Regulatory bodies, like the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), often scrutinize mergers and acquisitions to prevent monopolistic practices that could lead to higher prices and fewer choices for patients.\n\n# Key Success Factor\n\nHow do successful businesses handle concentration?\n\n# Proximity to key markets\n\nHealthcare and social assistance facilities provide services to local patients; facilities should be geographically located in areas where the need is higher and they can be easily accessed by the public.\n\n# Barriers to Entry\n\n|Challenge|Level|\n|---|---|\n|Legal|High|\n|Start-Up Costs|Steady|\n\n# What challenges do potential industry entrants face?\n\n- A complex and stringent regulatory environment governs all healthcare and social assistance delivery aspects at the federal, state and local levels.\n- Start-up costs for a healthcare facility can be substantial but vary by type of facility.

Providers will continue to contend with the drop-offs in federal programs related to COVID-19, but demographic and economic forces will persist in driving healthcare consumption.\n- Healthcare and social assistance providers will be increasingly vital in meeting the complex medical and social needs of people of advanced age, which make up a sizeable subset of the US population.\n- As Medicare enrollment expands, healthcare providers will become more reliant on those reimbursements as a revenue source. Still, private insurers will remain the top payer.\n\nThe pandemic’s long-term effects are emerging\n\n- This sector suffers from staffing shortages that predate the COVID-19 pandemic and became exacerbated by it. Labor shortages and employee burnout will continue challenging healthcare and social assistance providers.\n- Healthcare providers across the sector will grapple with steeper costs for everything from medical supplies to pharmaceuticals and staff. While many trends that initially drove up these costs will settle, that won’t necessarily translate to lower prices. Securing reimbursements from insurers that cover these higher costs will become even more critical for healthcare providers to maintain profit.\n- The pandemic accelerated the shift in healthcare delivery. Hospitals will stay the central focus in the health sector, but other care sites (ambulatory surgery centers, urgent care centers) will continue to see rising patient volumes. Ambulatory surgery centers’ focus on cost savings and convenience will contribute to their growing popularity.\n- The steadying patient volumes that followed the initial surge in people seeking healthcare treatments as the pandemic subsided won’t be felt by all healthcare providers. The pandemic's long-term toll on mental health will continue to be acutely felt by mental health and substance abuse centers and clinics.\n\nTech advances will reshape healthcare delivery\n\n- Tech advances can potentially transform every aspect of healthcare and social assistance delivery, but navigating tech investments, evolving regulations and cybersecurity will pose challenges. For example, providers will hasten their adoption of digital tools, but higher capital costs could slow the pace of a digital transformation for many. Healthcare providers can also expect the regulatory landscape regarding data privacy and security to intensify as more medical data goes digital.\n- While telemedicine’s ability to address physician shortages and lower costs will be invaluable, its utilization by patients and providers will depend on how the regulatory environment surrounding it evolves. For example, Medicare’s extension of telehealth flexibilities ends in December 2024; how Medicare adapts its telehealth policies for 2025 will determine patients’ access and providers’."", ""# Healthcare and Social Assistance in the US\n\n# Mar 2024\n\n- Medicare and Medicaid funding jumped following the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, as extended enrollment periods absorbed private insurance losses.\n- Higher Medicaid funding and enrollment continued throughout the pandemic, leading healthcare and social assistance facilities to receive larger shares of revenue from Medicaid reimbursements. Higher enrollment stemmed from the Families First Coronavirus Response Act of 2020, which mandated continuous coverage through March 31, 2023.\n- Medicaid reimbursements are expected to have accounted for less sector revenue in 2023. Congress' spending plan for 2023 allowed states to continue disenrollment in April of that year, and the Kaiser Family Foundation reported that more than 5.5 million enrollees lost coverage as of August 2023.\n- Yet Medicare will experience the fastest growth moving forward, as this segment will have the highest enrollment growth as the over 65 population advances further in age.\n\n# Insurance limitations create out-of-pocket costs\n\n- Insurers don't cover all health services equally. Patients are responsible for any portion of treatment not paid for by the insurance company.\n- Out-of-pocket payments include payments by patients or family members for any care not covered by insurance. This includes deductibles, copayments and coinsurance.\n- Rising incomes in recent years have allowed individuals to increase healthcare consumption. Out-of-pocket spending climbs alongside income since higher-income beneficiaries are more likely to use healthcare services.\n- Recessionary concerns and a higher cost of living led consumers to reevaluate their elective health spending in 2023, causing a slowdown in total health spending. Inflation, the resumption of student loan payments and steadying patient volumes will continue to slow out-of-pocket health spending in 2024.\n\n# Healthcare and social assistance receive payments from a mix of sources\n\n- Other sources of sector revenue include reimbursements from various federal, state and local programs, like workers’ compensation and maternal and child health programs; the Department of Defense; the Department of Veterans Affairs; charitable contributions (donations, gifts); and miscellaneous private sources.\n- Some medical facilities are designated nonprofits. Nonprofit facilities often rely on gifts and donations from the local community to fund essential services. Examples include safety net hospitals or nonprofit mental health clinics.\n- Some healthcare providers receive more federal assistance than others. For example, the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) annually awards billions in grants to mental health and substance abuse clinics.""]"

Facilities have raised wages to attract new clinical and nonclinical staff, but employees are turning to higher-paid positions with lower stress levels as a result of COVID-19 burnout.\n- Federal and state initiatives could help address staffing shortages and quality issues at these residential facilities. For example, a proposal by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) would require a federal staffing standard at nursing homes to improve safety and quality for residents. To meet this potential standard, CMS has announced $75.0 million in scholarships and tuition reimbursement for nursing students who agree to work in nursing homes.\n\n# Social assistance providers have an outsized role\n\n- Social assistance entities provide various types of assistance services directly to their clients. Industries in this subsector include Elderly and Disabled Services (62412), Day Care (62441) and Family Counseling and Crisis Intervention Services (62419).\n- Billions in federal funding to social assistance providers during COVID-19 from the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act and the American Rescue Plan led this segment's share of the sector to rise in recent years. Subsequent cuts in this funding affect the extent to which social assistance providers can keep up with demand for their resources and services.\n- Other effects of COVID-19 have influenced social assistance providers. For instance, the need for daycare services quickly dropped in 2020, but a sudden recovery in 2021 created excess demand.

How has the COVID-19 pandemic affected the US healthcare and social assistance sector?,"The COVID-19 pandemic created unprecedented financial, workforce, and supply chain challenges for the sector. It strained healthcare facilities as non-COVID patient levels dropped during the pandemic. Although patient volumes have recovered, providers face ongoing instability related to regulatory changes, labor shortages, inflation, and rising expenses.",text,other,22,62 Healthcare and Social Assistance in the US Industry Report.pdf,Assessing the impact of COVID-19 on the healthcare industry is essential for understanding current market conditions and future trends.,"The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly impacted the US healthcare and social assistance sector in several ways. It accelerated the adoption of telemedicine, which, while it has decreased from its peak during the pandemic, remains more integral to healthcare delivery than before. The pandemic also highlighted societal inequities, leading to increased reliance on social assistance providers as pandemic-era benefits ended, resulting in heightened demand for services like housing, food assistance, and childcare.

Healthcare providers faced persistent workforce shortages exacerbated by the pandemic, with many healthcare workers leaving the field due to burnout or seeking better-paying positions. This has particularly strained nursing services, contributing to high expenses for healthcare facilities. Additionally, rising costs for medical supplies and pharmaceuticals, coupled with stagnant government reimbursements, have further pressured the financial health of these providers.

The pandemic also accelerated consolidation trends within the healthcare sector, as larger health systems sought acquisitions to achieve economies of scale and enhance negotiating power with insurers. Overall, the pandemic has reshaped the landscape of healthcare and social assistance, revealing vulnerabilities and driving changes that continue to influence the sector.","[21, 70, 20]","['# IBISWorld | Healthcare and Social Assistance in the US\n\n# Mar 2024\n\n- The dramatic rise in the adoption of telemedicine in 2020 has fallen from its pandemic high but is still more integral to healthcare delivery in 2024 than pre-COVID, especially for providers offering mental health treatment.\n- The challenges impacting healthcare providers are also expediting the adoption of other digital tools (AI, patient engagement products, data analytics) to streamline operations and produce cost savings.\n\n# Social assistance providers fill in the gaps as pandemic-era benefits end\n\n- The pandemic highlighted societal inequities. Social assistance providers have had an outsized role in addressing these inequities since the COVID-19 pandemic subsided.\n- Pandemic relief funding that cushioned savings accounts and lifted many out of poverty ended between 2022 and 2023, with exact end dates varying between states. As benefits disappeared, millions turned to social assistance providers for help with housing, food assistance and child care.\n- The end of pandemic food assistance benefits coupled with rising inflation have made affording the cost of essentials like groceries too expensive for many. Food banks nationwide have reported record need for their services, squeezing their staff and supplies thin.\n- Day Care (62441) providers are vital to addressing critical shortages of child care, especially as parents return to in-office work.

Regulation regarding COVID-19 is determined and mandated by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) and the United States Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). Exact regulation can vary from state to state.', ""# IBISWorld | Healthcare and Social Assistance in the US\n\n# Mar 2024\n\n# Current Performance\n\n# What's driving current industry performance?\n\n# Demographic trends shape the healthcare landscape\n\n- Economic and demographic forces have fueled rising spending on healthcare and social assistance services in recent years.\n- The older population's expanding medical needs as they age are the primary force behind higher healthcare spending. The older demographic is linked explicitly to robust growth in areas like Elderly and Disabled Person Services (IBISWorld report 62412), Nursing Care Facilities (62311) and Assisted Living Facilities (OD6231).\n- Broader insurance coverage has also facilitated access to healthcare services. Higher enrollment in public insurance offset the pandemic-related drop-off in private insurance coverage. Still, the end of the continuous coverage requirement in March 2023 has allowed states to resume Medicaid terminations, resulting in consumer losses of Medicaid coverage since.\n\n# Healthcare providers grapple with persistent workforce shortages\n\n- COVID-19 exacerbated labor shortages that had existed prior to the onset of the pandemic. A large population that is over 65, low reimbursement rates and a retirement cliff fueled initial shortages. In 2024, healthcare facilities are struggling to attract and retain employees from a smaller employee pool as burnt-out healthcare staff quit, retire or jump to higher-paying positions.\n- Nursing shortages have been straining healthcare providers the most, and the American Hospital Association has reported that more than 100,000 registered nurses left the workforce between 2021 and 2023. The challenges that are driving these shortages remain, as reflected through the multiple nursing strikes in 2023, keeping expenses for these employees high.\n- While hiring challenges will weigh heavily on healthcare providers through 2024, other cost pressures will also strain their financial health. Rising prices for everything from devices to consumables and pharmaceuticals will eat at their bottom lines. Government reimbursements haven’t grown fast enough to cover these elevated costs, with providers’ ability to negotiate higher payments from private insurers left to determine their performance.\n- Federal relief lessened the blow of higher costs and low patient volumes between 2020 and 2021. The Provider Relief Fund, for instance, allocated $178.0 billion to bolster hospitals and other healthcare providers during the pandemic. Funding dissolved in 2022 for most healthcare and social assistance providers, leaving many providers struggling to stay profitable since.\n\n# The pandemic accelerated existing consolidation trends in healthcare\n\n- Larger health systems eye acquisitions to create economies of scale, lower costs and gain negotiating power. The pandemic accelerated the rising consolidation activity that had been occurring in recent years.\n- Private and public insurers only partially cover the cost of delivering healthcare, incentivizing healthcare providers to acquire an upper hand in provider-payer negotiations. Independent (often small or rural) practices risking service eliminations or closure have been targets of acquisitions.""]"

Additionally, broader insurance coverage has facilitated access to healthcare services, contributing to increased spending.","[13, 20, 68]","[""# Healthcare and Social Assistance in the US\n\n# SWOT\n\n|Strengths|Weaknesses|Opportunities|Threats|\n|---|---|---|---|\n|High Profit vs. Sector Average|Low Revenue per Employee|High Revenue Growth (2019-2024)|Low Revenue Growth (2005-2024)|\n|Low Customer Class Concentration|Low Product/Service Concentration|High Revenue Growth (2024-2029)|Low Outlier Number of people with private health insurance|\n|Low Capital Requirements| |Federal funding for Medicare and Medicaid| |\n\n# Executive Summary\n\nDemographic and economic factors are the driving forces behind rising healthcare spending in the US. The population's medical needs are expanding the oldest demographic's consumption of medical services. At the same time, growing incomes and broader insurance coverage facilitate access to healthcare providers. Increasing healthcare spending was abruptly disrupted by the pandemic, exposing healthcare and social assistance providers to unprecedented financial and operational pressures. Though pandemic concerns have alleviated, the long-term effects of it continue to shape every corner of the health sector. Still, revenue has been expanding at a CAGR of 0.7% to an estimated $3.6 trillion over the past five years, with revenue rising an expected 0.3% in 2024.\n\nThe pandemic exacerbated existing staffing shortages. Persistent labor shortages jeopardize healthcare and social assistance providers' ability to address demand, creating widespread staff burnout and high turnover rates. These shortages have fueled wage inflation in the sector and the use of costlier contract labor, squeezing profit. Some areas of Healthcare and Social Assistance are facing more critical shortages, and the long-term effects of the pandemic continue to make it difficult for companies to attract and retain employees to fill these gaps.\n\nDemographic trends will continue to be the driving force behind rising healthcare spending moving forward. However, increasing demand and elevated costs will pressure healthcare and social assistance providers to shift how they operate. Consolidation activity will ramp up as smaller providers join larger health groups to secure larger insurer reimbursements. Digital tools and telehealth will continue to be integrated into healthcare delivery because they can lower costs, increase capacity and enable access to patients in underserved areas. In all, sector revenue will grow at a CAGR of 2.7% to an estimated $4.1 trillion in the coming years."", ""# IBISWorld | Healthcare and Social Assistance in the US\n\n# Mar 2024\n\n# Current Performance\n\n# What's driving current industry performance?\n\n# Demographic trends shape the healthcare landscape\n\n- Economic and demographic forces have fueled rising spending on healthcare and social assistance services in recent years.\n- The older population's expanding medical needs as they age are the primary force behind higher healthcare spending. The older demographic is linked explicitly to robust growth in areas like Elderly and Disabled Person Services (IBISWorld report 62412), Nursing Care Facilities (62311) and Assisted Living Facilities (OD6231).\n- Broader insurance coverage has also facilitated access to healthcare services. Higher enrollment in public insurance offset the pandemic-related drop-off in private insurance coverage. Still, the end of the continuous coverage requirement in March 2023 has allowed states to resume Medicaid terminations, resulting in consumer losses of Medicaid coverage since.\n\n# Healthcare providers grapple with persistent workforce shortages\n\n- COVID-19 exacerbated labor shortages that had existed prior to the onset of the pandemic. A large population that is over 65, low reimbursement rates and a retirement cliff fueled initial shortages. In 2024, healthcare facilities are struggling to attract and retain employees from a smaller employee pool as burnt-out healthcare staff quit, retire or jump to higher-paying positions.\n- Nursing shortages have been straining healthcare providers the most, and the American Hospital Association has reported that more than 100,000 registered nurses left the workforce between 2021 and 2023. The challenges that are driving these shortages remain, as reflected through the multiple nursing strikes in 2023, keeping expenses for these employees high.\n- While hiring challenges will weigh heavily on healthcare providers through 2024, other cost pressures will also strain their financial health. Rising prices for everything from devices to consumables and pharmaceuticals will eat at their bottom lines. Government reimbursements haven’t grown fast enough to cover these elevated costs, with providers’ ability to negotiate higher payments from private insurers left to determine their performance.\n- Federal relief lessened the blow of higher costs and low patient volumes between 2020 and 2021. The Provider Relief Fund, for instance, allocated $178.0 billion to bolster hospitals and other healthcare providers during the pandemic. Funding dissolved in 2022 for most healthcare and social assistance providers, leaving many providers struggling to stay profitable since.\n\n# The pandemic accelerated existing consolidation trends in healthcare\n\n- Larger health systems eye acquisitions to create economies of scale, lower costs and gain negotiating power. The pandemic accelerated the rising consolidation activity that had been occurring in recent years.\n- Private and public insurers only partially cover the cost of delivering healthcare, incentivizing healthcare providers to acquire an upper hand in provider-payer negotiations. Independent (often small or rural) practices risking service eliminations or closure have been targets of acquisitions."", '# IBISWorld | Healthcare and Social Assistance in the US\n\n# Mar 2024\n\n# Federal funding for Medicare and Medicaid\n\n# Growth\n\n|Year|Growth Rate|\n|---|---|\n|2013|-8.0|\n|2016|0.99|\n|2019| |\n|2022| |\n|2025| |\n|2028| |\n\nSource: IBISWorld\n\nReimbursements from Medicaid and Medicare are a major source of revenue for healthcare providers, while Medicaid and Medicare coverage (and the extent of their benefits) determine access to healthcare services for many citizens.

Changes in health expenditure directly influence revenue for healthcare and social assistance providers.\n\nAdults 65 and older spend more on healthcare services than any other age group, an outcome of an inherently higher incidence of chronic illness and injury.

The population's medical needs are expanding the oldest demographic's consumption of medical services. At the same time, growing incomes and broader insurance coverage facilitate access to healthcare providers. Increasing healthcare spending was abruptly disrupted by the pandemic, exposing healthcare and social assistance providers to unprecedented financial and operational pressures. Though pandemic concerns have alleviated, the long-term effects of it continue to shape every corner of the health sector. Still, revenue has been expanding at a CAGR of 0.7% to an estimated $3.6 trillion over the past five years, with revenue rising an expected 0.3% in 2024.\n\nThe pandemic exacerbated existing staffing shortages. Persistent labor shortages jeopardize healthcare and social assistance providers' ability to address demand, creating widespread staff burnout and high turnover rates. These shortages have fueled wage inflation in the sector and the use of costlier contract labor, squeezing profit. Some areas of Healthcare and Social Assistance are facing more critical shortages, and the long-term effects of the pandemic continue to make it difficult for companies to attract and retain employees to fill these gaps.\n\nDemographic trends will continue to be the driving force behind rising healthcare spending moving forward. However, increasing demand and elevated costs will pressure healthcare and social assistance providers to shift how they operate. Consolidation activity will ramp up as smaller providers join larger health groups to secure larger insurer reimbursements. Digital tools and telehealth will continue to be integrated into healthcare delivery because they can lower costs, increase capacity and enable access to patients in underserved areas.

The population's medical needs are expanding the oldest demographic's consumption of medical services. At the same time, growing incomes and broader insurance coverage facilitate access to healthcare providers. Increasing healthcare spending was abruptly disrupted by the pandemic, exposing healthcare and social assistance providers to unprecedented financial and operational pressures. Though pandemic concerns have alleviated, the long-term effects of it continue to shape every corner of the health sector. Still, revenue has been expanding at a CAGR of 0.7% to an estimated $3.6 trillion over the past five years, with revenue rising an expected 0.3% in 2024.\n\nThe pandemic exacerbated existing staffing shortages. Persistent labor shortages jeopardize healthcare and social assistance providers' ability to address demand, creating widespread staff burnout and high turnover rates. These shortages have fueled wage inflation in the sector and the use of costlier contract labor, squeezing profit. Some areas of Healthcare and Social Assistance are facing more critical shortages, and the long-term effects of the pandemic continue to make it difficult for companies to attract and retain employees to fill these gaps.\n\nDemographic trends will continue to be the driving force behind rising healthcare spending moving forward. However, increasing demand and elevated costs will pressure healthcare and social assistance providers to shift how they operate. Consolidation activity will ramp up as smaller providers join larger health groups to secure larger insurer reimbursements. Digital tools and telehealth will continue to be integrated into healthcare delivery because they can lower costs, increase capacity and enable access to patients in underserved areas. In all, sector revenue will grow at a CAGR of 2.7% to an estimated $4.1 trillion in the coming years."", '# IBISWorld | Healthcare and Social Assistance in the US\n\n# Mar 2024\n\n# Major Markets\n\n# Industry revenue in 2024 broken down by key markets\n\n|Major Market Segmentation|Percentage|\n|---|---|\n|Private health insurance (SL.Itr)|30.4%|\n|Medicare ($789.2bn)|22.2%|\n|Medicaid ($675.4bn)|19.0%|\n|Out-of-pocket ($394.6bn)|11.1%|\n|Other third-party payers ($472.8bn)|13.3%|\n|Other health insurance programs ($142.2bn)|4.0%|\n\nSource: IBISWorld\n\n# What’s influencing demand from the industry’s markets?\n\n# Private insurers are the largest payer to healthcare and social assistance providers\n\n- Reimbursements from private payors include payments received from commercial health plans.

While consumers can cut back on elective procedures when spending tightens, people can't avoid medical services entirely.\n- A wide breadth of factors determines the prevalence of illness, injury and mental illness. External events, like the pandemic, can exacerbate physical and mental illness rates. The increasingly complex health needs of the subset of the US population that is of advanced age contribute to higher healthcare consumption.\n- Social assistance providers have a crucial role in promoting the well-being of individuals and communities but are simultaneously sensitive to changes in funding levels. The amount of funding available to social assistance programs and organizations directly influences their ability to deliver services and outreach and maintain quality assistance.\n\nHealthcare facilities' financial health relies on reimbursements\n\n- Reimbursements from public and private insurance programs influence healthcare providers’ financial stability. Changes in these reimbursements (determined by various competing factors) can occur annually and produce significant consequences for healthcare and social assistance facilities.\n- How public and private payors pay healthcare facilities for services differs. Prices paid by commercial insurers are determined by negotiations, whereas laws and regulations mandate costs for public insurers. Pricing pressures that tilt in favor of the public or private payors cause volatility.\n\nCOVID-19 strains healthcare delivery\n\n- The COVID-19 pandemic created unprecedented financial, workforce and supply chain challenges for the sector.\n- Financial pressures strained healthcare facilities as non-COVID patient levels dropped during the pandemic.

These include persistent workforce shortages, particularly among nursing staff, which have been exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic. Many healthcare workers have left the field due to burnout, retirement, or seeking higher-paying positions, leading to difficulties in attracting and retaining employees.

Additionally, rising operational costs are a major concern. Prices for medical devices, consumables, and pharmaceuticals have increased, while government reimbursements have not kept pace with these elevated costs. This situation places further financial strain on hospitals, especially as they navigate the complexities of negotiating higher payments from private insurers.

Moreover, the end of continuous coverage requirements has resulted in consumer losses of Medicaid coverage, impacting patient volumes and revenue.

A large population that is over 65, low reimbursement rates and a retirement cliff fueled initial shortages. In 2024, healthcare facilities are struggling to attract and retain employees from a smaller employee pool as burnt-out healthcare staff quit, retire or jump to higher-paying positions.\n- Nursing shortages have been straining healthcare providers the most, and the American Hospital Association has reported that more than 100,000 registered nurses left the workforce between 2021 and 2023. The challenges that are driving these shortages remain, as reflected through the multiple nursing strikes in 2023, keeping expenses for these employees high.\n- While hiring challenges will weigh heavily on healthcare providers through 2024, other cost pressures will also strain their financial health. Rising prices for everything from devices to consumables and pharmaceuticals will eat at their bottom lines. Government reimbursements haven’t grown fast enough to cover these elevated costs, with providers’ ability to negotiate higher payments from private insurers left to determine their performance.\n- Federal relief lessened the blow of higher costs and low patient volumes between 2020 and 2021. The Provider Relief Fund, for instance, allocated $178.0 billion to bolster hospitals and other healthcare providers during the pandemic. Funding dissolved in 2022 for most healthcare and social assistance providers, leaving many providers struggling to stay profitable since.\n\n# The pandemic accelerated existing consolidation trends in healthcare\n\n- Larger health systems eye acquisitions to create economies of scale, lower costs and gain negotiating power.

This subsector includes Hospitals (IBISWorld 62211), Psychiatric Hospitals (62221) and Specialty Hospitals (62231).\n- Rising incomes, broader access to public and private insurance programs and the medical needs of older citizens sustained hospital patient volumes before the COVID-19 pandemic. Yet hospitals were hit particularly hard by the drop in elective procedures and patient volumes following the onset of the pandemic.\n- Federal policies and billions of dollars in funding directed to hospitals alleviated the initial financial impact of revenue loss stemming from delays in elective care and drops in ER visits. According to the Kaiser Family Foundation (KFF), the size of grants varied significantly per hospital based on the payor mix.\n- Rapidly escalating costs for medical consumables, equipment and pharmaceuticals along with staffing shortages and employee burnout combine to create instability in the sector.\n- Financial pressures have accelerated hospitals' shift away from inpatient care. The popularity of telemedicine, an uptick in ambulatory surgery centers (ASCs) and new medical technologies facilitate the transition to outpatient care.\n\n# Ambulatory healthcare services are an alternative care site\n\n- Ambulatory healthcare service providers deliver healthcare services to patients and don't provide inpatient services. The primary industries in this subsector include Specialist Doctors (62111b), Primary Care Doctors (62111a) and Dentists (62121).\n- Rising incomes and expanding insurance coverage have facilitated access to ambulatory healthcare service providers. The medical needs of older people also create demand for these providers, and adults of advanced age exhibit the highest consumption of healthcare services.\n- Patient volumes dropped in 2020 as patients adopted stay-at-home measures and offices temporarily closed. These closures resulted in long care backlogs, leading patients to fulfill pent-up need for ambulatory medical services as vaccines became available and lockdowns lifted.\n- Extensive staffing shortages at ambulatory healthcare service providers compromise these facilities' ability to meet demand.\n- Consolidation activity is occurring across this subsector. The COVID-19 pandemic accelerated this trend, but rapidly growing demand and continual staffing shortages incentivize small providers to merge with larger health groups.\n- Primary care and dental practices both demonstrate consolidation activity. Smaller practices are joining larger health systems or private equity-backed groups to reap the benefits of negotiating power and economies of scale.\n\n# Nursing and residential care facilities are critical for people over 65\n\n- Nursing and residential care facilities provide residential care combined with either nursing, supervisory or medical care services.

A CON is a state-level regulatory mechanism for healthcare facilities that determines the public need for a new facility or service. Oversight via CON ensures health delivery services align with community needs to prevent heightened healthcare costs. Violations of the CON requirement can result in civil sanctions or revocation of a facility's license.\n\n# Antikickback Statute and Physician Self-Referral Laws\n\nThe federal Antikickback Statute prohibits the exchange of anything of value (financial incentives, low rents, excessive compensation) to incentivize the referral of business that's reimbursable by federal healthcare programs. Kickbacks promote overutilization of healthcare costs and corrupt decision-making by steering patients away from other services. The Physician Self-Referral Law, also known as the Stark Law, prohibits physicians from referring patients to a healthcare service if they or a family member have a financial relationship with that entity.\n\n# Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act\n\nAll healthcare providers, including mental health and substance abuse clinics, must comply with the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA). The HIPAA criteria outline controls the use of patient health data by any healthcare provider that stores, shares or sends private patient data.\n\n# The HITECH Act\n\nThe Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health (HITECH) Act mandates audits of healthcare providers to ensure they comply with HIPAA. The HITECH Act strengthens HIPAA by incentivizing providers to adopt electronic health records (EHR) and enforcing steeper penalties for noncompliance.\n\n# The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services provisions\n\nThe Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) makes payments to participating healthcare providers under its Medicare and Medicaid programs based on various formulas. Federal law mandates that services hospitals render to Medicare and Medicaid patients meet professionally recognized standards. In addition, CMS provisions ensure that the healthcare services are medically necessary and reimbursement claims are correctly filed.\n\n# The No Surprises Act\n\nThe No Surprises Act (NSA) established new federal protections against surprise medical bills. The NSA bans surprise bills for most emergency services, nonemergency services from out-of-network providers at in-network facilities and services from out-of-network air ambulance service providers.

This includes deductibles, copayments and coinsurance.\n- Rising incomes in recent years have allowed individuals to increase healthcare consumption. Out-of-pocket spending climbs alongside income since higher-income beneficiaries are more likely to use healthcare services.\n- Recessionary concerns and a higher cost of living led consumers to reevaluate their elective health spending in 2023, causing a slowdown in total health spending. Inflation, the resumption of student loan payments and steadying patient volumes will continue to slow out-of-pocket health spending in 2024.\n\n# Healthcare and social assistance receive payments from a mix of sources\n\n- Other sources of sector revenue include reimbursements from various federal, state and local programs, like workers’ compensation and maternal and child health programs; the Department of Defense; the Department of Veterans Affairs; charitable contributions (donations, gifts); and miscellaneous private sources.\n- Some medical facilities are designated nonprofits. Nonprofit facilities often rely on gifts and donations from the local community to fund essential services. Examples include safety net hospitals or nonprofit mental health clinics.\n- Some healthcare providers receive more federal assistance than others.

To meet this potential standard, CMS has announced $75.0 million in scholarships and tuition reimbursement for nursing students who agree to work in nursing homes.\n\n# Social assistance providers have an outsized role\n\n- Social assistance entities provide various types of assistance services directly to their clients. Industries in this subsector include Elderly and Disabled Services (62412), Day Care (62441) and Family Counseling and Crisis Intervention Services (62419).\n- Billions in federal funding to social assistance providers during COVID-19 from the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act and the American Rescue Plan led this segment's share of the sector to rise in recent years. Subsequent cuts in this funding affect the extent to which social assistance providers can keep up with demand for their resources and services.\n- Other effects of COVID-19 have influenced social assistance providers. For instance, the need for daycare services quickly dropped in 2020, but a sudden recovery in 2021 created excess demand. Closures and layoffs meant fewer daycare providers, leading to significant price hikes as parents scrambled to find childcare.\n\n# What are innovations in industry products and services?\n\n# Budding artificial intelligence partnerships are transforming service delivery\n\n- Artificial intelligence (AI) technologies are steadily being applied to functions across healthcare and social assistance facilities. This novel tech has been proven to improve outcomes in public health.\n- There are multiple innovation applications for AI in the Healthcare and Social Assistance sector, with many tailored to specific areas. Systems are emerging using AI that can identify and treat high-risk patients, predict heart attacks, forecast chronic kidney disease and standardize and protect patient medical data.\n\n# Digital health applications abound\n\n- The number of innovative digital health tools has flourished in recent years. These tools have the potential to transform healthcare delivery dramatically. Digital tools include telehealth, wearable technologies and digital therapeutics.\n- Telehealth capability improves patient engagement by expanding access to care, lowering costs and increasing efficiency.\n- Wearable technologies remotely monitor patients and provide valuable medical data that informs a patient's care team instantly, leading to more comprehensive care."", ""# IBISWorld | Healthcare and Social Assistance in the US\n\n# Mar 2024\n\n# Differentiation\n\n- Many aspects of healthcare delivery follow standard practices or treatments. Providers in competitive markets can differentiate through patient outcomes, staff qualifications and accolades, quality of services and availability of high-tech equipment.\n\n# Labor Expenses\n\n- Healthcare and social assistance facilities can't provide services without trained and qualified staff.

Higher enrollment stemmed from the Families First Coronavirus Response Act of 2020, which mandated continuous coverage through March 31, 2023.\n- Medicaid reimbursements are expected to have accounted for less sector revenue in 2023. Congress' spending plan for 2023 allowed states to continue disenrollment in April of that year, and the Kaiser Family Foundation reported that more than 5.5 million enrollees lost coverage as of August 2023.\n- Yet Medicare will experience the fastest growth moving forward, as this segment will have the highest enrollment growth as the over 65 population advances further in age.\n\n# Insurance limitations create out-of-pocket costs\n\n- Insurers don't cover all health services equally. Patients are responsible for any portion of treatment not paid for by the insurance company.\n- Out-of-pocket payments include payments by patients or family members for any care not covered by insurance. This includes deductibles, copayments and coinsurance.\n- Rising incomes in recent years have allowed individuals to increase healthcare consumption. Out-of-pocket spending climbs alongside income since higher-income beneficiaries are more likely to use healthcare services.\n- Recessionary concerns and a higher cost of living led consumers to reevaluate their elective health spending in 2023, causing a slowdown in total health spending. Inflation, the resumption of student loan payments and steadying patient volumes will continue to slow out-of-pocket health spending in 2024.\n\n# Healthcare and social assistance receive payments from a mix of sources\n\n- Other sources of sector revenue include reimbursements from various federal, state and local programs, like workers’ compensation and maternal and child health programs; the Department of Defense; the Department of Veterans Affairs; charitable contributions (donations, gifts); and miscellaneous private sources.\n- Some medical facilities are designated nonprofits. Nonprofit facilities often rely on gifts and donations from the local community to fund essential services. Examples include safety net hospitals or nonprofit mental health clinics.\n- Some healthcare providers receive more federal assistance than others. For example, the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) annually awards billions in grants to mental health and substance abuse clinics."", ""# IBISWorld | Healthcare and Social Assistance in the US\n\n# Mar 2024\n\n# Current Performance\n\n# What's driving current industry performance?\n\n# Demographic trends shape the healthcare landscape\n\n- Economic and demographic forces have fueled rising spending on healthcare and social assistance services in recent years.\n- The older population's expanding medical needs as they age are the primary force behind higher healthcare spending. The older demographic is linked explicitly to robust growth in areas like Elderly and Disabled Person Services (IBISWorld report 62412), Nursing Care Facilities (62311) and Assisted Living Facilities (OD6231).\n- Broader insurance coverage has also facilitated access to healthcare services. Higher enrollment in public insurance offset the pandemic-related drop-off in private insurance coverage. Still, the end of the continuous coverage requirement in March 2023 has allowed states to resume Medicaid terminations, resulting in consumer losses of Medicaid coverage since.\n\n# Healthcare providers grapple with persistent workforce shortages\n\n- COVID-19 exacerbated labor shortages that had existed prior to the onset of the pandemic. A large population that is over 65, low reimbursement rates and a retirement cliff fueled initial shortages. In 2024, healthcare facilities are struggling to attract and retain employees from a smaller employee pool as burnt-out healthcare staff quit, retire or jump to higher-paying positions.\n- Nursing shortages have been straining healthcare providers the most, and the American Hospital Association has reported that more than 100,000 registered nurses left the workforce between 2021 and 2023. The challenges that are driving these shortages remain, as reflected through the multiple nursing strikes in 2023, keeping expenses for these employees high.\n- While hiring challenges will weigh heavily on healthcare providers through 2024, other cost pressures will also strain their financial health. Rising prices for everything from devices to consumables and pharmaceuticals will eat at their bottom lines. Government reimbursements haven’t grown fast enough to cover these elevated costs, with providers’ ability to negotiate higher payments from private insurers left to determine their performance.\n- Federal relief lessened the blow of higher costs and low patient volumes between 2020 and 2021. The Provider Relief Fund, for instance, allocated $178.0 billion to bolster hospitals and other healthcare providers during the pandemic. Funding dissolved in 2022 for most healthcare and social assistance providers, leaving many providers struggling to stay profitable since.\n\n# The pandemic accelerated existing consolidation trends in healthcare\n\n- Larger health systems eye acquisitions to create economies of scale, lower costs and gain negotiating power. The pandemic accelerated the rising consolidation activity that had been occurring in recent years.\n- Private and public insurers only partially cover the cost of delivering healthcare, incentivizing healthcare providers to acquire an upper hand in provider-payer negotiations. Independent (often small or rural) practices risking service eliminations or closure have been targets of acquisitions.""]"

The population's medical needs are expanding the oldest demographic's consumption of medical services. At the same time, growing incomes and broader insurance coverage facilitate access to healthcare providers. Increasing healthcare spending was abruptly disrupted by the pandemic, exposing healthcare and social assistance providers to unprecedented financial and operational pressures. Though pandemic concerns have alleviated, the long-term effects of it continue to shape every corner of the health sector. Still, revenue has been expanding at a CAGR of 0.7% to an estimated $3.6 trillion over the past five years, with revenue rising an expected 0.3% in 2024.\n\nThe pandemic exacerbated existing staffing shortages. Persistent labor shortages jeopardize healthcare and social assistance providers' ability to address demand, creating widespread staff burnout and high turnover rates. These shortages have fueled wage inflation in the sector and the use of costlier contract labor, squeezing profit. Some areas of Healthcare and Social Assistance are facing more critical shortages, and the long-term effects of the pandemic continue to make it difficult for companies to attract and retain employees to fill these gaps.\n\nDemographic trends will continue to be the driving force behind rising healthcare spending moving forward. However, increasing demand and elevated costs will pressure healthcare and social assistance providers to shift how they operate. Consolidation activity will ramp up as smaller providers join larger health groups to secure larger insurer reimbursements. Digital tools and telehealth will continue to be integrated into healthcare delivery because they can lower costs, increase capacity and enable access to patients in underserved areas. In all, sector revenue will grow at a CAGR of 2.7% to an estimated $4.1 trillion in the coming years.""]"

Additionally, the legal challenges associated with compliance and the scrutiny from regulatory bodies, such as the Federal Trade Commission and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, further complicate the landscape for potential industry entrants.","[69, 47, 70]","[""# IBISWorld | Healthcare and Social Assistance in the US\n\n# Mar 2024\n\n# Regulation & Policy\n\nHigh Steady\n\n# What regulations impact the industry?\n\n# Certificate of Need\n\nHealthcare facilities must furnish a Certificate of Need (CON) before any construction, renovation or major medical equipment acquisitions. A CON is a state-level regulatory mechanism for healthcare facilities that determines the public need for a new facility or service. Oversight via CON ensures health delivery services align with community needs to prevent heightened healthcare costs. Violations of the CON requirement can result in civil sanctions or revocation of a facility's license.\n\n# Antikickback Statute and Physician Self-Referral Laws\n\nThe federal Antikickback Statute prohibits the exchange of anything of value (financial incentives, low rents, excessive compensation) to incentivize the referral of business that's reimbursable by federal healthcare programs. Kickbacks promote overutilization of healthcare costs and corrupt decision-making by steering patients away from other services. The Physician Self-Referral Law, also known as the Stark Law, prohibits physicians from referring patients to a healthcare service if they or a family member have a financial relationship with that entity.\n\n# Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act\n\nAll healthcare providers, including mental health and substance abuse clinics, must comply with the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA). The HIPAA criteria outline controls the use of patient health data by any healthcare provider that stores, shares or sends private patient data.\n\n# The HITECH Act\n\nThe Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health (HITECH) Act mandates audits of healthcare providers to ensure they comply with HIPAA.

The reasons for shortages are complex, with the exact extent of shortages varying between settings.\n- The pandemic exacerbated labor shortages that had already existed in this sector. The mental and physical burden on healthcare workers led to burnout, inspiring many employees to quit, retire or change careers.\n- Shortages of new workers and a high turnover rate of existing workers have caused many providers to offer signing bonuses and additional bonuses to retain employees. Maintaining appropriate staffing levels is critical and required by law for many providers, so labor expenses must rise enough for providers to fill vacancies.\n- Many providers have been using contract labor to fill in the roster. Contracted staff come at a higher cost than salaried employees, although the cost for locum tenens (i.e. temporary fill-in) staffing has been settling from its peak in 2021.\n\n# Financial pressures erode profit for healthcare and social assistance providers\n\n- Margins vary based on location, type of facility and payer mix. Healthcare providers receiving most of their revenue from commercial insurers enjoy higher profit.\n- Billions in pandemic relief funding kept healthcare and social assistance providers profitable between 2020 and 2021. A drop-off in funding in 2022 strained providers as costs continued rising.\n- The pandemic's aftermath continues to have a more acute effect on some healthcare providers. Hospitals, daycare centers, mental health and substance abuse centers garner less profit than other providers.\n- High inflation, rising wages and increasing operating costs will continue to pressure profit in 2024. While inflation is expected to cool through the year, healthcare providers will still have to manage securing reimbursements that offset higher prices to limit inflation’s impact on profit.\n\n# Key Ratios\n\n|Year|Revenue per Employee ($)|Revenue per Enterprise ($ Million)|Employees per Estab.

The reasons for shortages are complex, with the exact extent of shortages varying between settings.\n- The pandemic exacerbated labor shortages that had already existed in this sector. The mental and physical burden on healthcare workers led to burnout, inspiring many employees to quit, retire or change careers.\n- Shortages of new workers and a high turnover rate of existing workers have caused many providers to offer signing bonuses and additional bonuses to retain employees. Maintaining appropriate staffing levels is critical and required by law for many providers, so labor expenses must rise enough for providers to fill vacancies.\n- Many providers have been using contract labor to fill in the roster. Contracted staff come at a higher cost than salaried employees, although the cost for locum tenens (i.e. temporary fill-in) staffing has been settling from its peak in 2021.\n\n# Financial pressures erode profit for healthcare and social assistance providers\n\n- Margins vary based on location, type of facility and payer mix. Healthcare providers receiving most of their revenue from commercial insurers enjoy higher profit.\n- Billions in pandemic relief funding kept healthcare and social assistance providers profitable between 2020 and 2021. A drop-off in funding in 2022 strained providers as costs continued rising.\n- The pandemic's aftermath continues to have a more acute effect on some healthcare providers. Hospitals, daycare centers, mental health and substance abuse centers garner less profit than other providers.\n- High inflation, rising wages and increasing operating costs will continue to pressure profit in 2024. While inflation is expected to cool through the year, healthcare providers will still have to manage securing reimbursements that offset higher prices to limit inflation’s impact on profit.\n\n# Key Ratios\n\n|Year|Revenue per Employee ($)|Revenue per Enterprise ($ Million)|Employees per Estab.

The older demographic is linked explicitly to robust growth in areas like Elderly and Disabled Person Services (IBISWorld report 62412), Nursing Care Facilities (62311) and Assisted Living Facilities (OD6231).\n- Broader insurance coverage has also facilitated access to healthcare services. Higher enrollment in public insurance offset the pandemic-related drop-off in private insurance coverage. Still, the end of the continuous coverage requirement in March 2023 has allowed states to resume Medicaid terminations, resulting in consumer losses of Medicaid coverage since.\n\n# Healthcare providers grapple with persistent workforce shortages\n\n- COVID-19 exacerbated labor shortages that had existed prior to the onset of the pandemic. A large population that is over 65, low reimbursement rates and a retirement cliff fueled initial shortages. In 2024, healthcare facilities are struggling to attract and retain employees from a smaller employee pool as burnt-out healthcare staff quit, retire or jump to higher-paying positions.\n- Nursing shortages have been straining healthcare providers the most, and the American Hospital Association has reported that more than 100,000 registered nurses left the workforce between 2021 and 2023. The challenges that are driving these shortages remain, as reflected through the multiple nursing strikes in 2023, keeping expenses for these employees high.\n- While hiring challenges will weigh heavily on healthcare providers through 2024, other cost pressures will also strain their financial health. Rising prices for everything from devices to consumables and pharmaceuticals will eat at their bottom lines. Government reimbursements haven’t grown fast enough to cover these elevated costs, with providers’ ability to negotiate higher payments from private insurers left to determine their performance.\n- Federal relief lessened the blow of higher costs and low patient volumes between 2020 and 2021. The Provider Relief Fund, for instance, allocated $178.0 billion to bolster hospitals and other healthcare providers during the pandemic. Funding dissolved in 2022 for most healthcare and social assistance providers, leaving many providers struggling to stay profitable since.\n\n# The pandemic accelerated existing consolidation trends in healthcare\n\n- Larger health systems eye acquisitions to create economies of scale, lower costs and gain negotiating power. The pandemic accelerated the rising consolidation activity that had been occurring in recent years.\n- Private and public insurers only partially cover the cost of delivering healthcare, incentivizing healthcare providers to acquire an upper hand in provider-payer negotiations. Independent (often small or rural) practices risking service eliminations or closure have been targets of acquisitions."", ""# IBISWorld | Healthcare and Social Assistance in the US\n\n# Mar 2024\n\n# Outlook\n\n↑ 2024-29 Revenue CAGR +2.7%\n\n# What's driving the industry outlook?\n\nDemographic trends are behind rising healthcare spending\n\n- Consumer spending on healthcare and social assistance services won't slow in the coming years. Providers will continue to contend with the drop-offs in federal programs related to COVID-19, but demographic and economic forces will persist in driving healthcare consumption.\n- Healthcare and social assistance providers will be increasingly vital in meeting the complex medical and social needs of people of advanced age, which make up a sizeable subset of the US population.\n- As Medicare enrollment expands, healthcare providers will become more reliant on those reimbursements as a revenue source. Still, private insurers will remain the top payer.\n\nThe pandemic’s long-term effects are emerging\n\n- This sector suffers from staffing shortages that predate the COVID-19 pandemic and became exacerbated by it. Labor shortages and employee burnout will continue challenging healthcare and social assistance providers.\n- Healthcare providers across the sector will grapple with steeper costs for everything from medical supplies to pharmaceuticals and staff. While many trends that initially drove up these costs will settle, that won’t necessarily translate to lower prices. Securing reimbursements from insurers that cover these higher costs will become even more critical for healthcare providers to maintain profit.\n- The pandemic accelerated the shift in healthcare delivery. Hospitals will stay the central focus in the health sector, but other care sites (ambulatory surgery centers, urgent care centers) will continue to see rising patient volumes. Ambulatory surgery centers’ focus on cost savings and convenience will contribute to their growing popularity.\n- The steadying patient volumes that followed the initial surge in people seeking healthcare treatments as the pandemic subsided won’t be felt by all healthcare providers. The pandemic's long-term toll on mental health will continue to be acutely felt by mental health and substance abuse centers and clinics.\n\nTech advances will reshape healthcare delivery\n\n- Tech advances can potentially transform every aspect of healthcare and social assistance delivery, but navigating tech investments, evolving regulations and cybersecurity will pose challenges. For example, providers will hasten their adoption of digital tools, but higher capital costs could slow the pace of a digital transformation for many. Healthcare providers can also expect the regulatory landscape regarding data privacy and security to intensify as more medical data goes digital.\n- While telemedicine’s ability to address physician shortages and lower costs will be invaluable, its utilization by patients and providers will depend on how the regulatory environment surrounding it evolves. For example, Medicare’s extension of telehealth flexibilities ends in December 2024; how Medicare adapts its telehealth policies for 2025 will determine patients’ access and providers’."", ""# Healthcare and Social Assistance in the US\n\n# SWOT\n\n|Strengths|Weaknesses|Opportunities|Threats|\n|---|---|---|---|\n|High Profit vs. Sector Average|Low Revenue per Employee|High Revenue Growth (2019-2024)|Low Revenue Growth (2005-2024)|\n|Low Customer Class Concentration|Low Product/Service Concentration|High Revenue Growth (2024-2029)|Low Outlier Number of people with private health insurance|\n|Low Capital Requirements| |Federal funding for Medicare and Medicaid| |\n\n# Executive Summary\n\nDemographic and economic factors are the driving forces behind rising healthcare spending in the US. The population's medical needs are expanding the oldest demographic's consumption of medical services. At the same time, growing incomes and broader insurance coverage facilitate access to healthcare providers. Increasing healthcare spending was abruptly disrupted by the pandemic, exposing healthcare and social assistance providers to unprecedented financial and operational pressures. Though pandemic concerns have alleviated, the long-term effects of it continue to shape every corner of the health sector. Still, revenue has been expanding at a CAGR of 0.7% to an estimated $3.6 trillion over the past five years, with revenue rising an expected 0.3% in 2024.\n\nThe pandemic exacerbated existing staffing shortages. Persistent labor shortages jeopardize healthcare and social assistance providers' ability to address demand, creating widespread staff burnout and high turnover rates. These shortages have fueled wage inflation in the sector and the use of costlier contract labor, squeezing profit. Some areas of Healthcare and Social Assistance are facing more critical shortages, and the long-term effects of the pandemic continue to make it difficult for companies to attract and retain employees to fill these gaps.\n\nDemographic trends will continue to be the driving force behind rising healthcare spending moving forward. However, increasing demand and elevated costs will pressure healthcare and social assistance providers to shift how they operate. Consolidation activity will ramp up as smaller providers join larger health groups to secure larger insurer reimbursements. Digital tools and telehealth will continue to be integrated into healthcare delivery because they can lower costs, increase capacity and enable access to patients in underserved areas. In all, sector revenue will grow at a CAGR of 2.7% to an estimated $4.1 trillion in the coming years.""]"

As benefits disappeared, millions turned to social assistance providers for help with housing, food assistance and child care.\n- The end of pandemic food assistance benefits coupled with rising inflation have made affording the cost of essentials like groceries too expensive for many. Food banks nationwide have reported record need for their services, squeezing their staff and supplies thin.\n- Day Care (62441) providers are vital to addressing critical shortages of child care, especially as parents return to in-office work.

Facilities have raised wages to attract new clinical and nonclinical staff, but employees are turning to higher-paid positions with lower stress levels as a result of COVID-19 burnout.\n- Federal and state initiatives could help address staffing shortages and quality issues at these residential facilities. For example, a proposal by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) would require a federal staffing standard at nursing homes to improve safety and quality for residents. To meet this potential standard, CMS has announced $75.0 million in scholarships and tuition reimbursement for nursing students who agree to work in nursing homes.\n\n# Social assistance providers have an outsized role\n\n- Social assistance entities provide various types of assistance services directly to their clients. Industries in this subsector include Elderly and Disabled Services (62412), Day Care (62441) and Family Counseling and Crisis Intervention Services (62419).\n- Billions in federal funding to social assistance providers during COVID-19 from the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act and the American Rescue Plan led this segment's share of the sector to rise in recent years. Subsequent cuts in this funding affect the extent to which social assistance providers can keep up with demand for their resources and services.\n- Other effects of COVID-19 have influenced social assistance providers. For instance, the need for daycare services quickly dropped in 2020, but a sudden recovery in 2021 created excess demand. Closures and layoffs meant fewer daycare providers, leading to significant price hikes as parents scrambled to find childcare.\n\n# What are innovations in industry products and services?\n\n# Budding artificial intelligence partnerships are transforming service delivery\n\n- Artificial intelligence (AI) technologies are steadily being applied to functions across healthcare and social assistance facilities. This novel tech has been proven to improve outcomes in public health.\n- There are multiple innovation applications for AI in the Healthcare and Social Assistance sector, with many tailored to specific areas. Systems are emerging using AI that can identify and treat high-risk patients, predict heart attacks, forecast chronic kidney disease and standardize and protect patient medical data.\n\n# Digital health applications abound\n\n- The number of innovative digital health tools has flourished in recent years. These tools have the potential to transform healthcare delivery dramatically. Digital tools include telehealth, wearable technologies and digital therapeutics.\n- Telehealth capability improves patient engagement by expanding access to care, lowering costs and increasing efficiency.\n- Wearable technologies remotely monitor patients and provide valuable medical data that informs a patient's care team instantly, leading to more comprehensive care.""]"

The increasingly complex health needs of the subset of the US population that is of advanced age contribute to higher healthcare consumption.\n- Social assistance providers have a crucial role in promoting the well-being of individuals and communities but are simultaneously sensitive to changes in funding levels. The amount of funding available to social assistance programs and organizations directly influences their ability to deliver services and outreach and maintain quality assistance.\n\nHealthcare facilities' financial health relies on reimbursements\n\n- Reimbursements from public and private insurance programs influence healthcare providers’ financial stability. Changes in these reimbursements (determined by various competing factors) can occur annually and produce significant consequences for healthcare and social assistance facilities.\n- How public and private payors pay healthcare facilities for services differs. Prices paid by commercial insurers are determined by negotiations, whereas laws and regulations mandate costs for public insurers. Pricing pressures that tilt in favor of the public or private payors cause volatility.\n\nCOVID-19 strains healthcare delivery\n\n- The COVID-19 pandemic created unprecedented financial, workforce and supply chain challenges for the sector.\n- Financial pressures strained healthcare facilities as non-COVID patient levels dropped during the pandemic. Patient volumes have recovered, but healthcare providers face ongoing instability related to regulatory changes, a large population of citizens over 65, labor shortages, inflation and rising expenses.""]"

The end of pandemic relief funding in 2022 strained providers as they continued to encounter increasing operating expenses, including high inflation and rising wages. Additionally, the ongoing labor shortages have led to higher labor costs, as many providers have had to offer bonuses to attract and retain staff. 

Profit margins vary significantly based on location, facility type, and payer mix, with those relying heavily on commercial insurers generally faring better. However, many providers, such as hospitals and mental health centers, have reported lower profitability. The inability to secure adequate reimbursements from government and private insurers to offset these rising costs has further pressured their financial health. Overall, the combination of these factors has made it increasingly difficult for healthcare providers to maintain profitability.","[74, 21, 20]","[""# IBISWorld | Healthcare and Social Assistance in the US\n\n# Mar 2024\n\nChart displays current year only in the PDF version of this report. You can view and download chart for all other years associated with this industry on my.ibisworld.com.\n\n# What trends impact industry costs?\n\n# Healthcare providers confront the exodus of workers\n\n- Labor shortages that characterize the health sector have been driving wage growth. The reasons for shortages are complex, with the exact extent of shortages varying between settings.\n- The pandemic exacerbated labor shortages that had already existed in this sector. The mental and physical burden on healthcare workers led to burnout, inspiring many employees to quit, retire or change careers.\n- Shortages of new workers and a high turnover rate of existing workers have caused many providers to offer signing bonuses and additional bonuses to retain employees. Maintaining appropriate staffing levels is critical and required by law for many providers, so labor expenses must rise enough for providers to fill vacancies.\n- Many providers have been using contract labor to fill in the roster. Contracted staff come at a higher cost than salaried employees, although the cost for locum tenens (i.e. temporary fill-in) staffing has been settling from its peak in 2021.\n\n# Financial pressures erode profit for healthcare and social assistance providers\n\n- Margins vary based on location, type of facility and payer mix. Healthcare providers receiving most of their revenue from commercial insurers enjoy higher profit.\n- Billions in pandemic relief funding kept healthcare and social assistance providers profitable between 2020 and 2021. A drop-off in funding in 2022 strained providers as costs continued rising.\n- The pandemic's aftermath continues to have a more acute effect on some healthcare providers. Hospitals, daycare centers, mental health and substance abuse centers garner less profit than other providers.\n- High inflation, rising wages and increasing operating costs will continue to pressure profit in 2024. While inflation is expected to cool through the year, healthcare providers will still have to manage securing reimbursements that offset higher prices to limit inflation’s impact on profit.\n\n# Key Ratios\n\n|Year|Revenue per Employee ($)|Revenue per Enterprise ($ Million)|Employees per Estab.

Social assistance providers have had an outsized role in addressing these inequities since the COVID-19 pandemic subsided.\n- Pandemic relief funding that cushioned savings accounts and lifted many out of poverty ended between 2022 and 2023, with exact end dates varying between states. As benefits disappeared, millions turned to social assistance providers for help with housing, food assistance and child care.\n- The end of pandemic food assistance benefits coupled with rising inflation have made affording the cost of essentials like groceries too expensive for many. Food banks nationwide have reported record need for their services, squeezing their staff and supplies thin.\n- Day Care (62441) providers are vital to addressing critical shortages of child care, especially as parents return to in-office work. The industry has struggled to recover from the pandemic as it attempts to meet excess demand, with the end of funding in late 2023 only exacerbating staffing issues, tight margins and steep fees.', ""# IBISWorld | Healthcare and Social Assistance in the US\n\n# Mar 2024\n\n# Current Performance\n\n# What's driving current industry performance?\n\n# Demographic trends shape the healthcare landscape\n\n- Economic and demographic forces have fueled rising spending on healthcare and social assistance services in recent years.\n- The older population's expanding medical needs as they age are the primary force behind higher healthcare spending. The older demographic is linked explicitly to robust growth in areas like Elderly and Disabled Person Services (IBISWorld report 62412), Nursing Care Facilities (62311) and Assisted Living Facilities (OD6231).\n- Broader insurance coverage has also facilitated access to healthcare services. Higher enrollment in public insurance offset the pandemic-related drop-off in private insurance coverage. Still, the end of the continuous coverage requirement in March 2023 has allowed states to resume Medicaid terminations, resulting in consumer losses of Medicaid coverage since.\n\n# Healthcare providers grapple with persistent workforce shortages\n\n- COVID-19 exacerbated labor shortages that had existed prior to the onset of the pandemic. A large population that is over 65, low reimbursement rates and a retirement cliff fueled initial shortages. In 2024, healthcare facilities are struggling to attract and retain employees from a smaller employee pool as burnt-out healthcare staff quit, retire or jump to higher-paying positions.\n- Nursing shortages have been straining healthcare providers the most, and the American Hospital Association has reported that more than 100,000 registered nurses left the workforce between 2021 and 2023. The challenges that are driving these shortages remain, as reflected through the multiple nursing strikes in 2023, keeping expenses for these employees high.\n- While hiring challenges will weigh heavily on healthcare providers through 2024, other cost pressures will also strain their financial health. Rising prices for everything from devices to consumables and pharmaceuticals will eat at their bottom lines. Government reimbursements haven’t grown fast enough to cover these elevated costs, with providers’ ability to negotiate higher payments from private insurers left to determine their performance.\n- Federal relief lessened the blow of higher costs and low patient volumes between 2020 and 2021. The Provider Relief Fund, for instance, allocated $178.0 billion to bolster hospitals and other healthcare providers during the pandemic. Funding dissolved in 2022 for most healthcare and social assistance providers, leaving many providers struggling to stay profitable since.\n\n# The pandemic accelerated existing consolidation trends in healthcare\n\n- Larger health systems eye acquisitions to create economies of scale, lower costs and gain negotiating power.

The older demographic is linked explicitly to robust growth in areas like Elderly and Disabled Person Services (IBISWorld report 62412), Nursing Care Facilities (62311) and Assisted Living Facilities (OD6231).\n- Broader insurance coverage has also facilitated access to healthcare services. Higher enrollment in public insurance offset the pandemic-related drop-off in private insurance coverage. Still, the end of the continuous coverage requirement in March 2023 has allowed states to resume Medicaid terminations, resulting in consumer losses of Medicaid coverage since.\n\n# Healthcare providers grapple with persistent workforce shortages\n\n- COVID-19 exacerbated labor shortages that had existed prior to the onset of the pandemic. A large population that is over 65, low reimbursement rates and a retirement cliff fueled initial shortages. In 2024, healthcare facilities are struggling to attract and retain employees from a smaller employee pool as burnt-out healthcare staff quit, retire or jump to higher-paying positions.\n- Nursing shortages have been straining healthcare providers the most, and the American Hospital Association has reported that more than 100,000 registered nurses left the workforce between 2021 and 2023. The challenges that are driving these shortages remain, as reflected through the multiple nursing strikes in 2023, keeping expenses for these employees high.\n- While hiring challenges will weigh heavily on healthcare providers through 2024, other cost pressures will also strain their financial health. Rising prices for everything from devices to consumables and pharmaceuticals will eat at their bottom lines. Government reimbursements haven’t grown fast enough to cover these elevated costs, with providers’ ability to negotiate higher payments from private insurers left to determine their performance.\n- Federal relief lessened the blow of higher costs and low patient volumes between 2020 and 2021. The Provider Relief Fund, for instance, allocated $178.0 billion to bolster hospitals and other healthcare providers during the pandemic. Funding dissolved in 2022 for most healthcare and social assistance providers, leaving many providers struggling to stay profitable since.\n\n# The pandemic accelerated existing consolidation trends in healthcare\n\n- Larger health systems eye acquisitions to create economies of scale, lower costs and gain negotiating power. The pandemic accelerated the rising consolidation activity that had been occurring in recent years.\n- Private and public insurers only partially cover the cost of delivering healthcare, incentivizing healthcare providers to acquire an upper hand in provider-payer negotiations.

Higher enrollment stemmed from the Families First Coronavirus Response Act of 2020, which mandated continuous coverage through March 31, 2023.\n- Medicaid reimbursements are expected to have accounted for less sector revenue in 2023. Congress' spending plan for 2023 allowed states to continue disenrollment in April of that year, and the Kaiser Family Foundation reported that more than 5.5 million enrollees lost coverage as of August 2023.\n- Yet Medicare will experience the fastest growth moving forward, as this segment will have the highest enrollment growth as the over 65 population advances further in age.\n\n# Insurance limitations create out-of-pocket costs\n\n- Insurers don't cover all health services equally. Patients are responsible for any portion of treatment not paid for by the insurance company.\n- Out-of-pocket payments include payments by patients or family members for any care not covered by insurance. This includes deductibles, copayments and coinsurance.\n- Rising incomes in recent years have allowed individuals to increase healthcare consumption. Out-of-pocket spending climbs alongside income since higher-income beneficiaries are more likely to use healthcare services.\n- Recessionary concerns and a higher cost of living led consumers to reevaluate their elective health spending in 2023, causing a slowdown in total health spending. Inflation, the resumption of student loan payments and steadying patient volumes will continue to slow out-of-pocket health spending in 2024.\n\n# Healthcare and social assistance receive payments from a mix of sources\n\n- Other sources of sector revenue include reimbursements from various federal, state and local programs, like workers’ compensation and maternal and child health programs; the Department of Defense; the Department of Veterans Affairs; charitable contributions (donations, gifts); and miscellaneous private sources.\n- Some medical facilities are designated nonprofits. Nonprofit facilities often rely on gifts and donations from the local community to fund essential services. Examples include safety net hospitals or nonprofit mental health clinics.\n- Some healthcare providers receive more federal assistance than others. For example, the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) annually awards billions in grants to mental health and substance abuse clinics.""]"

What are the main sources of funding for healthcare facilities in the US?,"The main sources include reimbursements from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), federal support programs like those during COVID-19, and direct funding or funding that promotes access from the federal government.",text,other,71,62 Healthcare and Social Assistance in the US Industry Report.pdf,Identifying key funding sources is essential for understanding the financial dynamics of the healthcare industry.,"Healthcare facilities in the US primarily receive funding from several key sources. Major sources include reimbursements from Medicare and Medicaid, which are crucial for revenue generation. Federal funding also plays a significant role, particularly through programs like the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security (CARES) Act and the Paycheck Protection Program, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic. Additionally, healthcare facilities benefit from various federal, state, and local programs, including workers’ compensation and maternal and child health programs. Nonprofit facilities often rely on community donations and gifts to support their services. Furthermore, organizations like the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) provide grants specifically for mental health and substance abuse clinics.","[71, 68, 36]","[""# Healthcare and Social Assistance in the US\n\n# Assistance\n\n# What assistance is available to this industry?\n\n# The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services\n\nThe Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) manages reimbursements for patients' healthcare services at a healthcare facility. Various provisions determine CMS reimbursements, which change based on location and designation. Reimbursements generally vary annually based on CMS' Physicians Fee Schedule.\n\n# COVID-19 response\n\nHealthcare facilities were primary recipients of federal support programs during COVID-19 in response to their vital role in combatting it. Facilities were allocated over $100.0 billion from the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security (CARES) Act and $75.0 billion from the Paycheck Protection Program. The Provider Relief Fund, the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) and the American Rescue Plan also allocated billions in funding.\n\n# Federal initiatives\n\nThe federal government is a significant funding source for healthcare facilities through direct funding or funding that promotes access. Recent examples include the Biden Administration's use of federal courts and health programs to expand the use of medication to treat substance use disorders in pregnant women or expansion to Medicare and Medicaid programs.\n\n# The American Hospital Association\n\nThe American Hospital Association (AHA) is a national organization representing all types of hospitals, healthcare networks, patients and communities. The AHA comprises over 5,000 hospitals, health care systems, networks and 43,000 individual members.\n\n# Industry organizations\n\nAn organization represents nearly every industry operating as a healthcare or social assistance facility. Industry organizations are businesses or individuals in a specific industry joined together to promote, advocate, lobby and set standards for members.

Higher coverage rates lower out-of-pocket costs for patients, increasing access to healthcare services.\n\nTotal health expenditure measures public and private spending on services and activities that promote health and prevent disease, including physicians and other medical professionals, home healthcare agencies, nursing homes, hospitals and health insurers. Changes in health expenditure directly influence revenue for healthcare and social assistance providers.\n\nAdults 65 and older spend more on healthcare services than any other age group, an outcome of an inherently higher incidence of chronic illness and injury. This population subset’s expanding medical needs are a main driver behind rising healthcare spending, as this age group requires more frequent, high-cost services.', ""# Healthcare and Social Assistance in the US\n\n# Mar 2024\n\n- Medicare and Medicaid funding jumped following the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, as extended enrollment periods absorbed private insurance losses.\n- Higher Medicaid funding and enrollment continued throughout the pandemic, leading healthcare and social assistance facilities to receive larger shares of revenue from Medicaid reimbursements. Higher enrollment stemmed from the Families First Coronavirus Response Act of 2020, which mandated continuous coverage through March 31, 2023.\n- Medicaid reimbursements are expected to have accounted for less sector revenue in 2023. Congress' spending plan for 2023 allowed states to continue disenrollment in April of that year, and the Kaiser Family Foundation reported that more than 5.5 million enrollees lost coverage as of August 2023.\n- Yet Medicare will experience the fastest growth moving forward, as this segment will have the highest enrollment growth as the over 65 population advances further in age.\n\n# Insurance limitations create out-of-pocket costs\n\n- Insurers don't cover all health services equally. Patients are responsible for any portion of treatment not paid for by the insurance company.\n- Out-of-pocket payments include payments by patients or family members for any care not covered by insurance. This includes deductibles, copayments and coinsurance.\n- Rising incomes in recent years have allowed individuals to increase healthcare consumption. Out-of-pocket spending climbs alongside income since higher-income beneficiaries are more likely to use healthcare services.\n- Recessionary concerns and a higher cost of living led consumers to reevaluate their elective health spending in 2023, causing a slowdown in total health spending. Inflation, the resumption of student loan payments and steadying patient volumes will continue to slow out-of-pocket health spending in 2024.\n\n# Healthcare and social assistance receive payments from a mix of sources\n\n- Other sources of sector revenue include reimbursements from various federal, state and local programs, like workers’ compensation and maternal and child health programs; the Department of Defense; the Department of Veterans Affairs; charitable contributions (donations, gifts); and miscellaneous private sources.\n- Some medical facilities are designated nonprofits. Nonprofit facilities often rely on gifts and donations from the local community to fund essential services. Examples include safety net hospitals or nonprofit mental health clinics.\n- Some healthcare providers receive more federal assistance than others. For example, the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) annually awards billions in grants to mental health and substance abuse clinics.""]"

A drop-off in funding in 2022 strained providers as costs continued rising.\n- The pandemic's aftermath continues to have a more acute effect on some healthcare providers. Hospitals, daycare centers, mental health and substance abuse centers garner less profit than other providers.\n- High inflation, rising wages and increasing operating costs will continue to pressure profit in 2024.

The population's medical needs are expanding the oldest demographic's consumption of medical services. At the same time, growing incomes and broader insurance coverage facilitate access to healthcare providers. Increasing healthcare spending was abruptly disrupted by the pandemic, exposing healthcare and social assistance providers to unprecedented financial and operational pressures. Though pandemic concerns have alleviated, the long-term effects of it continue to shape every corner of the health sector. Still, revenue has been expanding at a CAGR of 0.7% to an estimated $3.6 trillion over the past five years, with revenue rising an expected 0.3% in 2024.\n\nThe pandemic exacerbated existing staffing shortages. Persistent labor shortages jeopardize healthcare and social assistance providers' ability to address demand, creating widespread staff burnout and high turnover rates. These shortages have fueled wage inflation in the sector and the use of costlier contract labor, squeezing profit. Some areas of Healthcare and Social Assistance are facing more critical shortages, and the long-term effects of the pandemic continue to make it difficult for companies to attract and retain employees to fill these gaps.\n\nDemographic trends will continue to be the driving force behind rising healthcare spending moving forward. However, increasing demand and elevated costs will pressure healthcare and social assistance providers to shift how they operate. Consolidation activity will ramp up as smaller providers join larger health groups to secure larger insurer reimbursements.

What are the main factors contributing to labor shortages in the healthcare sector?,"Labor shortages are driven by complex reasons varying between settings, exacerbated by the pandemic which led to burnout and career changes among healthcare workers. Shortages of new workers and high turnover rates of existing workers are also contributing factors.",text,other,74,62 Healthcare and Social Assistance in the US Industry Report.pdf,Understanding labor shortages is crucial for assessing industry costs and operational challenges.,"Labor shortages in the healthcare sector are primarily driven by several factors. The pandemic has intensified existing shortages, leading to increased burnout among healthcare workers, which has resulted in many choosing to quit, retire, or switch careers. Additionally, there is a lack of new workers entering the field, coupled with a high turnover rate among current staff. These challenges have compelled many providers to offer signing bonuses and other incentives to attract and retain employees. The need to maintain appropriate staffing levels, often mandated by law, further exacerbates the situation, leading to rising labor expenses as providers seek to fill vacancies.","[34, 48, 74]","['# IBISWorld | Healthcare and Social Assistance in the US\n\n# Mar 2024\n\n# Key Success Factor\n\nWhat products or services do successful businesses offer?\n\n- Secure a multiskilled workforce\n\nHealthcare and social assistance facilities are labor-intensive, requiring a staff of physicians, specialists, nurses and nonclinical workers.

While consumers can cut back on elective procedures when spending tightens, people can't avoid medical services entirely.\n- A wide breadth of factors determines the prevalence of illness, injury and mental illness. External events, like the pandemic, can exacerbate physical and mental illness rates. The increasingly complex health needs of the subset of the US population that is of advanced age contribute to higher healthcare consumption.\n- Social assistance providers have a crucial role in promoting the well-being of individuals and communities but are simultaneously sensitive to changes in funding levels. The amount of funding available to social assistance programs and organizations directly influences their ability to deliver services and outreach and maintain quality assistance.\n\nHealthcare facilities' financial health relies on reimbursements\n\n- Reimbursements from public and private insurance programs influence healthcare providers’ financial stability. Changes in these reimbursements (determined by various competing factors) can occur annually and produce significant consequences for healthcare and social assistance facilities.\n- How public and private payors pay healthcare facilities for services differs. Prices paid by commercial insurers are determined by negotiations, whereas laws and regulations mandate costs for public insurers. Pricing pressures that tilt in favor of the public or private payors cause volatility.\n\nCOVID-19 strains healthcare delivery\n\n- The COVID-19 pandemic created unprecedented financial, workforce and supply chain challenges for the sector.\n- Financial pressures strained healthcare facilities as non-COVID patient levels dropped during the pandemic.

Providers will continue to contend with the drop-offs in federal programs related to COVID-19, but demographic and economic forces will persist in driving healthcare consumption.\n- Healthcare and social assistance providers will be increasingly vital in meeting the complex medical and social needs of people of advanced age, which make up a sizeable subset of the US population.\n- As Medicare enrollment expands, healthcare providers will become more reliant on those reimbursements as a revenue source. Still, private insurers will remain the top payer.\n\nThe pandemic’s long-term effects are emerging\n\n- This sector suffers from staffing shortages that predate the COVID-19 pandemic and became exacerbated by it. Labor shortages and employee burnout will continue challenging healthcare and social assistance providers.\n- Healthcare providers across the sector will grapple with steeper costs for everything from medical supplies to pharmaceuticals and staff. While many trends that initially drove up these costs will settle, that won’t necessarily translate to lower prices. Securing reimbursements from insurers that cover these higher costs will become even more critical for healthcare providers to maintain profit.\n- The pandemic accelerated the shift in healthcare delivery. Hospitals will stay the central focus in the health sector, but other care sites (ambulatory surgery centers, urgent care centers) will continue to see rising patient volumes. Ambulatory surgery centers’ focus on cost savings and convenience will contribute to their growing popularity.\n- The steadying patient volumes that followed the initial surge in people seeking healthcare treatments as the pandemic subsided won’t be felt by all healthcare providers. The pandemic's long-term toll on mental health will continue to be acutely felt by mental health and substance abuse centers and clinics.\n\nTech advances will reshape healthcare delivery\n\n- Tech advances can potentially transform every aspect of healthcare and social assistance delivery, but navigating tech investments, evolving regulations and cybersecurity will pose challenges. For example, providers will hasten their adoption of digital tools, but higher capital costs could slow the pace of a digital transformation for many. Healthcare providers can also expect the regulatory landscape regarding data privacy and security to intensify as more medical data goes digital.\n- While telemedicine’s ability to address physician shortages and lower costs will be invaluable, its utilization by patients and providers will depend on how the regulatory environment surrounding it evolves. For example, Medicare’s extension of telehealth flexibilities ends in December 2024; how Medicare adapts its telehealth policies for 2025 will determine patients’ access and providers’."", ""# IBISWorld | Healthcare and Social Assistance in the US\n\n# Mar 2024\n\n# Current Performance\n\n# What's driving current industry performance?\n\n# Demographic trends shape the healthcare landscape\n\n- Economic and demographic forces have fueled rising spending on healthcare and social assistance services in recent years.\n- The older population's expanding medical needs as they age are the primary force behind higher healthcare spending.

Maintaining appropriate staffing levels is critical and required by law for many providers, so labor expenses must rise enough for providers to fill vacancies.\n- Many providers have been using contract labor to fill in the roster.

While inflation is expected to cool through the year, healthcare providers will still have to manage securing reimbursements that offset higher prices to limit inflation’s impact on profit.\n\n# Key Ratios\n\n|Year|Revenue per Employee ($)|Revenue per Enterprise ($ Million)|Employees per Estab.

Social assistance providers have had an outsized role in addressing these inequities since the COVID-19 pandemic subsided.\n- Pandemic relief funding that cushioned savings accounts and lifted many out of poverty ended between 2022 and 2023, with exact end dates varying between states. As benefits disappeared, millions turned to social assistance providers for help with housing, food assistance and child care.\n- The end of pandemic food assistance benefits coupled with rising inflation have made affording the cost of essentials like groceries too expensive for many. Food banks nationwide have reported record need for their services, squeezing their staff and supplies thin.\n- Day Care (62441) providers are vital to addressing critical shortages of child care, especially as parents return to in-office work. The industry has struggled to recover from the pandemic as it attempts to meet excess demand, with the end of funding in late 2023 only exacerbating staffing issues, tight margins and steep fees.', ""# IBISWorld | Healthcare and Social Assistance in the US\n\n# Mar 2024\n\n# Current Performance\n\n# What's driving current industry performance?\n\n# Demographic trends shape the healthcare landscape\n\n- Economic and demographic forces have fueled rising spending on healthcare and social assistance services in recent years.\n- The older population's expanding medical needs as they age are the primary force behind higher healthcare spending. The older demographic is linked explicitly to robust growth in areas like Elderly and Disabled Person Services (IBISWorld report 62412), Nursing Care Facilities (62311) and Assisted Living Facilities (OD6231).\n- Broader insurance coverage has also facilitated access to healthcare services. Higher enrollment in public insurance offset the pandemic-related drop-off in private insurance coverage. Still, the end of the continuous coverage requirement in March 2023 has allowed states to resume Medicaid terminations, resulting in consumer losses of Medicaid coverage since.\n\n# Healthcare providers grapple with persistent workforce shortages\n\n- COVID-19 exacerbated labor shortages that had existed prior to the onset of the pandemic. A large population that is over 65, low reimbursement rates and a retirement cliff fueled initial shortages. In 2024, healthcare facilities are struggling to attract and retain employees from a smaller employee pool as burnt-out healthcare staff quit, retire or jump to higher-paying positions.\n- Nursing shortages have been straining healthcare providers the most, and the American Hospital Association has reported that more than 100,000 registered nurses left the workforce between 2021 and 2023. The challenges that are driving these shortages remain, as reflected through the multiple nursing strikes in 2023, keeping expenses for these employees high.\n- While hiring challenges will weigh heavily on healthcare providers through 2024, other cost pressures will also strain their financial health. Rising prices for everything from devices to consumables and pharmaceuticals will eat at their bottom lines. Government reimbursements haven’t grown fast enough to cover these elevated costs, with providers’ ability to negotiate higher payments from private insurers left to determine their performance.\n- Federal relief lessened the blow of higher costs and low patient volumes between 2020 and 2021. The Provider Relief Fund, for instance, allocated $178.0 billion to bolster hospitals and other healthcare providers during the pandemic. Funding dissolved in 2022 for most healthcare and social assistance providers, leaving many providers struggling to stay profitable since.\n\n# The pandemic accelerated existing consolidation trends in healthcare\n\n- Larger health systems eye acquisitions to create economies of scale, lower costs and gain negotiating power. The pandemic accelerated the rising consolidation activity that had been occurring in recent years.\n- Private and public insurers only partially cover the cost of delivering healthcare, incentivizing healthcare providers to acquire an upper hand in provider-payer negotiations. Independent (often small or rural) practices risking service eliminations or closure have been targets of acquisitions.""]"

The population's medical needs are expanding the oldest demographic's consumption of medical services. At the same time, growing incomes and broader insurance coverage facilitate access to healthcare providers. Increasing healthcare spending was abruptly disrupted by the pandemic, exposing healthcare and social assistance providers to unprecedented financial and operational pressures. Though pandemic concerns have alleviated, the long-term effects of it continue to shape every corner of the health sector. Still, revenue has been expanding at a CAGR of 0.7% to an estimated $3.6 trillion over the past five years, with revenue rising an expected 0.3% in 2024.\n\nThe pandemic exacerbated existing staffing shortages. Persistent labor shortages jeopardize healthcare and social assistance providers' ability to address demand, creating widespread staff burnout and high turnover rates. These shortages have fueled wage inflation in the sector and the use of costlier contract labor, squeezing profit. Some areas of Healthcare and Social Assistance are facing more critical shortages, and the long-term effects of the pandemic continue to make it difficult for companies to attract and retain employees to fill these gaps.\n\nDemographic trends will continue to be the driving force behind rising healthcare spending moving forward. However, increasing demand and elevated costs will pressure healthcare and social assistance providers to shift how they operate. Consolidation activity will ramp up as smaller providers join larger health groups to secure larger insurer reimbursements. Digital tools and telehealth will continue to be integrated into healthcare delivery because they can lower costs, increase capacity and enable access to patients in underserved areas. In all, sector revenue will grow at a CAGR of 2.7% to an estimated $4.1 trillion in the coming years."", '# IBISWorld | Healthcare and Social Assistance in the US\n\n# Mar 2024\n\n# 10.

The reasons for shortages are complex, with the exact extent of shortages varying between settings.\n- The pandemic exacerbated labor shortages that had already existed in this sector. The mental and physical burden on healthcare workers led to burnout, inspiring many employees to quit, retire or change careers.\n- Shortages of new workers and a high turnover rate of existing workers have caused many providers to offer signing bonuses and additional bonuses to retain employees. Maintaining appropriate staffing levels is critical and required by law for many providers, so labor expenses must rise enough for providers to fill vacancies.\n- Many providers have been using contract labor to fill in the roster. Contracted staff come at a higher cost than salaried employees, although the cost for locum tenens (i.e. temporary fill-in) staffing has been settling from its peak in 2021.\n\n# Financial pressures erode profit for healthcare and social assistance providers\n\n- Margins vary based on location, type of facility and payer mix. Healthcare providers receiving most of their revenue from commercial insurers enjoy higher profit.\n- Billions in pandemic relief funding kept healthcare and social assistance providers profitable between 2020 and 2021. A drop-off in funding in 2022 strained providers as costs continued rising.\n- The pandemic's aftermath continues to have a more acute effect on some healthcare providers. Hospitals, daycare centers, mental health and substance abuse centers garner less profit than other providers.\n- High inflation, rising wages and increasing operating costs will continue to pressure profit in 2024. While inflation is expected to cool through the year, healthcare providers will still have to manage securing reimbursements that offset higher prices to limit inflation’s impact on profit.\n\n# Key Ratios\n\n|Year|Revenue per Employee ($)|Revenue per Enterprise ($ Million)|Employees per Estab.
