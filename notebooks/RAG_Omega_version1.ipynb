The population's medical needs are expanding the oldest demographic's consumption of medical services. At the same time, growing incomes and broader insurance coverage facilitate access to healthcare providers. Increasing healthcare spending was abruptly disrupted by the pandemic, exposing healthcare and social assistance providers to unprecedented financial and operational pressures. Though pandemic concerns have alleviated, the long-term effects of it continue to shape every corner of the health sector. Still, revenue has been expanding at a CAGR of 0.7% to an estimated $3.6 trillion over the past five years, with revenue rising an expected 0.3% in 2024.\n",
            "\n",
            "The pandemic exacerbated existing staffing shortages. Persistent labor shortages jeopardize healthcare and social assistance providers' ability to address demand, creating widespread staff burnout and high turnover rates. These shortages have fueled wage inflation in the sector and the use of costlier contract labor, squeezing profit. Some areas of Healthcare and Social Assistance are facing more critical shortages, and the long-term effects of the pandemic continue to make it difficult for companies to attract and retain employees to fill these gaps.\n",
            "\n",
            "Demographic trends will continue to be the driving force behind rising healthcare spending moving forward. However, increasing demand and elevated costs will pressure healthcare and social assistance providers to shift how they operate. Consolidation activity will ramp up as smaller providers join larger health groups to secure larger insurer reimbursements. Digital tools and telehealth will continue to be integrated into healthcare delivery because they can lower costs, increase capacity and enable access to patients in underserved areas. In all, sector revenue will grow at a CAGR of 2.7% to an estimated $4.1 trillion in the coming years.\n"
