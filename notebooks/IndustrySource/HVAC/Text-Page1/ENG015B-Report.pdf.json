A steam boiler system is used to transform the water into steam and uses gravity and pressure to provide the heat. A hot water boiler uses a circulator pump to circulate hot water with the help of a piping system to provide heat. Hot water boilers are generally more efficient than steam boilers.\n\nBoilers are used in residential, industrial, and commercial HVAC systems. They are used by many industries, including petrochemical, food and beverage, power, and chemicals, to generate process heat. The growing demand for efficient space and water heating systems, coupled with stringent government regulations to limit carbon emissions, are expected to drive the future demand for boilers.\n\n## Furnaces\n\nGrowing residential construction, particularly in the Asia-Pacific region, is driving the market for furnaces. Rising industrial investments are also projected to boost demand for furnaces, especially in emerging markets such as China and India.\n\n## Heat Pumps\n\nA heat pump is a central HVAC system that pumps hot air from inside the home to the outside spaces to cool down the interior environment. A heat pump also reverses the flow of hot air into the home. The most widely used heat pump is the air-source heat pump, which transfers heat between the house and the outside air.\n\nA standard heat pump is more economical than a fuel-fired furnace in most applications. Many homes use a traditional electric heat pump, but the performance of this type of pump can decline in colder climates. In 2021, the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) launched the Residential Cold Climate Heat Pump Technology Challenge to accelerate the deployment of cold climate heat pumps (CCHPs). Newer technology CCHPs operate with greater capacity and efficiency at outdoor temperatures below 32\u00b0F.\n\n## Space Heaters\n\nSpace heaters are used in homes to maintain individual rooms at the desired temperature. Space heaters are generally used when the HVAC system is inadequate, or the homeowner is under budget constraints for installing HVAC. A space heater run on electricity or fuel and use considerably less energy than alternative type of heaters. Small space heaters are less expensive for heating one room or operating for a short period. Space heaters can be convection, radiant or combination. In May 2022, some 117.7 million U.S. homes used space heaters (U.S. Energy Information Administration, 2023)<sup>20</sup>.\n\n## Other Types of Heating Equipment\n\nOther types of heating equipment include radiant heating systems, which provide heat directly to the panels or floor of a house's ceiling or wall. The systems depend on radiant heat transfer, which delivers heat directly from the hot surface to the user and objects in the room via infrared radiation. Radiant heating is considered more efficient than forced-air heating because it reduces duct losses."}, {"markdown": "# Heating, Ventilation and Air Conditioning: Global Markets\n\n## Ventilation Equipment\n\nA ventilation system circulates and exchanges air within a building. It consists of an air handler, ducts, return vents, and a blower assembly. These components work together to provide mechanical ventilation, reduce humidity levels and normalize temperatures throughout the home. The ventilation equipment also helps to improve indoor air quality through temperature control, oxygen replenishment and removal of moisture, odors, smoke, heat, dust, airborne bacteria, carbon dioxide and other gases.\n\nVentilation is most widely used for commercial and industrial spaces to maintain the indoor air quality by displacing and diluting indoor pollutants. Ventilation is also used to control humidity, temperature, and air motion. It helps prevent air impurities and condensation.\n\n### Table 5 Global Market for Ventilation Equipment, by Type, Through 2028 ($ Billions)\n\n| Type | 2022 | 2023 | 2024 | 2026 | 2028 | CAGR% 2023\u20132028 |\n|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|\n| Air purifiers | 11.2 | 11.5 | 12.0 | 13.3 | 14.8 | 5.1 |\n| Air filters | 9.2 | 9.8 | 10.7 | 12.4 | 14.6 | 8.3 |\n| Humidifiers | 5.7 | 6.1 | 6.5 | 7.3 | 8.4 | 6.6 |\n| Air handling units | 5.5 | 5.7 | 6.1 | 6.9 | 7.8 | 6.5 |\n| Ventilation fans | 3.3 | 3.5 | 3.6 | 4.0 | 4.3 | 4.2 |\n| Others | 2.5 | 2.5 | 2.6 | 2.7 | 2.9 | 3.4 |\n| Total | 37.3 | 39.1 | 41.5 | 46.6 | 52.8 | 6.2 |\n\n*Source: BCC Research*"}, {"markdown": "# Heating, Ventilation and Air Conditioning: Global Markets\n\n## Figure 7\nGlobal Market Shares of Ventilation Equipment, by Type, 2022\n\n| Type | Percentage |\n| --- | --- |\n| Air filters | 24.7% |\n| Air handling units | 14.7% |\n| Air purifiers | 29.9% |\n| Humidifiers | 15.3% |\n| Ventilation fans | 8.8% |\n| Others | 6.6% |\n\n### Air Filters\nThe HVAC system filters remove pet dander, dust, pollen and other small particles from the air that users breathe. The filters block these particles to prevent them from being recirculated.\n\nHVAC air filters differ with respect to the material used for the filter. The material used depends on the need. A simple pleated filter will prevent debris, such as dust, from getting into the system, whereas a more complex task, such as odor removal, will require a charcoal element. The Minimum Efficiency Reporting Value (MERV) of an air filter measures its effectiveness in preventing smaller particles from passing through the filter medium.\n\n### Air Handling Units\nAir handling units (AHUs) collect outside air and room air, remove particles and dust from the collected air, adjusts the humidity and temperature, and then supply fresh air into the rooms via ducts. An AHU has several components, including a blower/fan, evaporator coil, heating elements, silencers, plenums, air filters and dampers. The air handler is usually situated inside a house's basement, attic or a dedicated closet space, and is connected to the ductwork throughout the house that allows the distribution of conditioned air into different rooms."}, {"markdown": "# Heating, Ventilation and Air Conditioning: Global Markets\n\n## Air Purifiers\n\nAir purifiers remove contaminants from the air circulating through the heating and cooling system. Contaminants are removed via mechanical filters, electromagnetic charges or hydrogen peroxide. Filtration usually occurs when expended air is brought back into the HVAC equipment to be conditioned and distributed again. Because these particles can interfere with the optimal operation of the HVAC system, air filters capture the contaminants to protect the system.\n\nThe American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air-Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) recommends a MERV rating of 14 or greater for hospitals and surgical centers that routinely use HVAC air purifiers, with MERV ratings of 13-16 due to COVID-19 concerns. Purifiers are also critical in safeguarding the HVAC system against more substantial particles that could cause damage. The purifier used must be the proper type and replaced when it becomes dirty. Air purifiers lengthen the lifespan of the HVAC system and can help reduce electric bills.\n\n## Humidifiers\n\nIn the HVAC industry, humidification is the process that introduces either humidity or water steam to an environment's air. It can improve the health of family members, help reduce energy costs and protect the household environment. Attaching a humidifier to the HVAC system maintains a comfortable moisture level, improves sleep quality, and can protect the floors or furniture if the humidity levels are lower than standards.\n\nWhen the HVAC system warms the air in the winter, it absorbs healthy moisture. The air can become so dry that it causes problems for families and homes. The best way to reincorporate an appropriate amount of moisture into the home's air is by using a home humidifier in the HVAC system. By incorporating humidifiers in the HVAC system, the humidity in the air can be controlled through a thermostat or a humidistat, By using the thermostat/humidistat, it is possible to manage the moisture of the home and even set preferences to be adjusted automatically as per choice.\n\n## Ventilation Fans\n\nVentilation fans are used to move air through HVAC systems. These fans are integrated with air handling systems that bring fresh air into the premises. The most common HVAC fans are forward-curved centrifugal, axial and backward-inclined, and each fan is uniquely suited to specific applications. Axial fans in an HVAC system are used for cooling or diluted ventilation. These can be powered by either AC or DC supply. Axial fans are used as an HVAC fan system in smelters, steel mills, foundries, boiler-making industries, laundries, brick kilns, glassworks, textiles, bakeries and power stations.\n\nCentrifugal fans are ideal for producing large amounts of air for cooling and ventilation purposes. These fans use the centrifuge to enhance the air volume and offer high-pressure, high-volume air output. With their energy efficiency and versatility, centrifugal fans are better for larger systems such as air-handling units, air pollution and filtration systems, and drying systems. Centrifugal fans come in a variety of models, depending on space requirements."}, {"markdown": "# Heating, Ventilation and Air Conditioning: Global Markets\n\n## Other Types\nThe other types segment includes dehumidifiers and energy recovery systems (ERVs). Dehumidifiers help remove excess moisture in the air, which can cause mold growth, musty odors and health issues. This helps the cooling system work more efficiently. It is a low-cost investment that also improves indoor air quality and helps extend the life of the HVAC system.\n\nAn ERV system uses two fans: one to pull fresh air into the building and another to push the stale air out. A heat exchanger transfers the heat and moisture from one air stream to another, preventing heat loss from this ventilation method. Eventually, it transfers heat and moisture to keep the home warm. An ERV system captures allergens, contaminants and other pollutants as the air enters the house. It can also improve energy efficiency, reduce contaminants and lower humidity. Also, ERV systems will keep the ductwork and filters in the HVAC system cleaner for longer, which means less maintenance is required.\n\n## Cooling Equipment\nCooling equipment, which includes fans, air conditioners and industrial coolers, regulates the temperature of the interior of the environment. Air conditioning, or cooling, is more complex than a typical heating solution. Air conditioners use energy to take heat away. The familiar air conditioning system uses a compressor to transfer heat from the house to the outdoors.\n\n### Global Market for Cooling Equipment, by Type, Through 2028\n\n| Type | 2022 | 2023 | 2024 | 2026 | 2028 | CAGR% 2023\u20132028 |\n|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|\n| Air conditioners | 105.1 | 109.6 | 114.3 | 125.4 | 139.0 | 4.9 |\n| Chillers | 25.2 | 26.6 | 28.1 | 31.2 | 35.0 | 5.6 |\n| Water cooling towers | 13.6 | 14.1 | 14.6 | 15.8 | 17.1 | 3.9 |\n| Others | 7.7 | 7.9 | 8.1 | 8.6 | 9.2 | 3.1 |\n| Total | 151.6 | 158.2 | 165.1 | 181.0 | 200.3 | 4.8 |\n\nSource: BCC Research"}, {"markdown": "# Heating, Ventilation and Air Conditioning: Global Markets\n\n## Figure 8\nGlobal Market Shares of Cooling Equipment, by Type, 2022\n\n| Type | Percentage |\n| --- | --- |\n| Chillers | 16.6% |\n| Air conditioners | 69.3% |\n| Water cooling towers | 9.0% |\n| Others | 5.1% |\n\n## Chillers\nA chiller circulates a liquid such as water or heat medium as a cooling liquid whose temperature is regulated by the refrigerant cycle. Chillers can be water-cooled or air-cooled. They tend to be preferred over traditional split systems as the water conducts heat better than air. Water-cooled chillers are more consistent and efficient in their performance and have a longer lifespan than air-cooled chillers.\n\nWater-cooled chillers are typically found in large facilities such as airports, hospitals, hotels, shopping malls and commercial buildings. Air-cooled chillers are more prevalent in smaller facilities, where space and water may be limited. These chillers are used for restaurants, corporate and sporting events, and temporary structures. Chillers are also often used for medical or industrial applications. Assembly equipment, lasers, MRI machines, construction sites and other high-powered equipment and facilities require chillers to sustain a workable temperature.\n\n## Air Conditioners\nAn air conditioner controls the humidity, temperature and air quality in residential and commercial spaces. Air conditioners come in central or split-system, window units or ductless varieties. They can improve the user's sleep quality and help reduce allergens such as pet hair/dander, dust particles, mold spores and other airborne contaminants that can aggravate asthma or trigger allergies. Also, they help remove excess moisture, which prevents humidity-related problems such as musty odors or mold."}, {"markdown": "# Heating, Ventilation and Air Conditioning: Global Markets\n\n## Water Cooling Towers\n\nCooling towers are heat removal devices that eliminate waste heat from the condenser water leaving a chiller. Cooling towers are usually placed on rooftops or other outdoor sites. They offer advantages such as efficient heat rejection, maintaining optimal system performance, cost-effectiveness and improved indoor air quality in commercial and residential applications. Commercial cooling towers are typically smaller and used in commercial air conditioning systems, such as apartments, office buildings, hotels, hospitals, and shopping centers. Industrial cooling towers are larger and more robust in design, and are used in heavy industrial processes, such as power generation, chemical production, and petrochemical refining, which generate significant amounts of heat as a by-product. There is a growing trend among industrial users to procure cooling towers integrated with the HVAC system.\n\n## Other Types\n\nOther types of cooling equipment include variable refrigerant flow (VRF) systems and evaporative air coolers. VRF systems use heat recovery systems or heat pumps to deliver powerful heating and cooling for all indoor and outdoor units without air ducts. VRF allows multiple indoor units to run on the same system. VRF systems offer a high degree of comfort, efficiency, and reliability.\n\nAn evaporative cooler uses an electric-powered fan to draw hot, dry air through a dampened pad and blow the cooled air out into the room. Evaporative air coolers deliver 100% fresh, filtered, cool air that eliminates the need to shut doors and windows they work more efficiently when doors and windows are left open.\n\n## HVAC Market, by Installation Type\n\nThe HVAC market can also be segmented by installation type, i.e., new construction or retrofit/replacement. Retrofitting, the process of adding new technology to an older system, can be achieved at a fraction of the cost of a complete replacement while improving efficiency and reducing energy bills. Retrofitting HVAC systems not only improves energy efficiency but also enhances indoor comfort and air quality. The new construction segment is also expected to grow over the coming years due to a rise in new construction activities.\n\n### Global Market for HVAC, by Installation Type, Through 2028\n\n| Installation Type | 2022 | 2023 | 2024 | 2026 | 2028 | CAGR% 2023\u20132028 |\n|--------------------|------|------|------|------|------|------------------|\n| New construction   | 146.1 | 152.6 | 159.7 | 176.0 | 195.3 | 5.1 |\n| Retrofitting and replacement | 105.0 | 111.0 | 117.7 | 132.9 | 151.4 | 6.4 |\n| Total | 251.1 | 263.6 | 277.4 | 308.9 | 346.7 | 5.6 |\n\nSource: BCC Research"}, {"markdown": "# Heating, Ventilation and Air Conditioning: Global Markets\n\n## Figure 9\nGlobal Market Shares of HVAC, by Installation Type, 2022\n\n| Installation Type | Percentage |\n|-------------------|------------|\n| New Construction  | 58.2%      |\n| Retrofitting and Replacement | 41.8% |\n\nSource: BCC Research\n\n### New Construction\nThe boom in new construction will boost the installation of new HVAC systems in the near and mid-term.
