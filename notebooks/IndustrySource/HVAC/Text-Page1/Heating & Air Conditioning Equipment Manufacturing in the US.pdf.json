By the outset of 2022, interest rates were at historic lows and residential demand boomed. Aided by historically low interest rates, housing starts, which measure the number of new, privately owned housing units built, increased rapidly in the years following the pandemic's start. Consistent growth in disposable income has also made consumers more willing to spend on remodeling projects, including the replacement of air conditioners and heaters. More recently, the sharp rise in inflation has caused the Federal Reserve to rapidly increase interest rates. The sharp rise in interest rates since the middle of 2022 has reduced housing demand, thereby undercutting the need for HVACR equipment.\n\nDemand for commercial space since the pandemic. Rising interest rates and prices have weighed on HVACR equipment sales growth, contributing to an expected cooling in downstream markets. Industry revenue is forecast to drop at a CAGR of 0.1% to $52.4 billion through the end of 2024, with a 1.2% climb expected during 2024 as renovation and building activity continue to expand.\n\nA widening trade gap has tempered opportunities for revenue expansion, as major global HVACR manufacturers have expanded their production facilities in countries with low labor costs. Imported HVACR products have increased, while industry exports have declined over the past five years. This trade gap has also been exacerbated by an appreciation of the US dollar, which makes industry exports relatively more expensive and less attractive to buyers overseas. Lower-cost imports have prevented domestic manufacturers from expanding profit.\n\nManufacturers will benefit from recovering nonresidential construction activity over the next five years, boosting spending on HVACR installations, upgrades and retrofits. Continued growth in consumer spending is also expected to drive demand for industry products, especially among downstream industries.

This undercut the demand for HVACR products from commercial clients. \n\nThe industry hinges on demand from contractors that install and repair climate control systems in new construction and renovation projects, which declined across virtually all commercial segments throughout the pandemic.\n\n## MANUFACTURERS ADAPT TO STRINGENT ENERGY EFFICIENCY REGULATIONS\n\nRising concerns about climate change have filtered down to the industry. Regulations designed to improve energy efficiency have become more stringent, forcing manufacturers to innovate.\n\nIn 2006, a minimum efficiency standard for new central air conditioning systems was set and air conditioners and heat pumps are now rated on a seasonal energy-efficiency ratio (SEER).\n\nHVACR units with a greater heating or cooling output per unit of energy consumption receive a higher SEER rating. Consumers interested in reducing energy consumption, both for environmental concerns and to reduce energy costs, are drawn to these higher-rated products.\n\nNew air conditioning systems have been subject to rising SEER requirements, with the minimum SEER slated to climb from 13 to 14 beginning in 2023.\n\n## THE INDUSTRY HAS BECOME INCREASINGLY GLOBALIZED  \n\nThe HVACR industry has become ever more globalized, with international trade growing in importance over the past two decades.

Higher-than-anticipated rate hikes have caused mortgage rates to rapidly increase, tempering construction activity. As a result, the growth in the value of residential construction will be limited over the next five years, limiting demand for HVACR installations and upgrades.\n\n## Commercial Markets Slated to Rebound\n\nSteady per capita disposable income growth and higher consumer spending are anticipated to increase spending at restaurants and other food service businesses in the future. Growth in restaurants and other food service businesses is expected to stimulate further demand for refrigeration equipment, such as walk-in coolers and refrigerated display cases. Commercial construction, which came to a halt during the pandemic, is expected to generate demand as businesses upgrade refrigeration for inventories and provide ventilation for commercial venues.\n\n## Globalization Will Provide New Avenues for Exported HVACR Equipment\n\nExport opportunities will remain strong moving forward, primarily focused on North American markets because of their proximity.

Mexico alone accounts for nearly a third of all imports.\n\nHowever, the lower labor costs in countries like Mexico will also encourage imports from countries where labor costs are even lower, like China. HVACR products manufactured in China have already grown to account for nearly a third of all imported industry products.\n\nWith the pace of imports expected to remain strong, the industry's trade balance will become increasingly lopsided.
