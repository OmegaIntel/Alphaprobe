    "executive_summary": "Over the past five years, the furniture stores industry has been significantly impacted by the growth of e-commerce and changing consumer preferences towards online shopping. The COVID-19 pandemic accelerated this trend, forcing more consumers to shop online. Other key trends include increased demand for customization, personalization, and unique furniture pieces. The industry also experienced a boost from the rise in home renovations and redecorations during the pandemic. However, high interest rates and economic uncertainty towards the end of the period slowed revenue growth. Looking ahead, the industry will face challenges from economic volatility, intensified competition (especially from e-commerce and direct-to-consumer brands), and the rise of the used furniture market driven by sustainability concerns. To remain competitive, furniture stores will need to offer value-added services, unique selling points, and adapt to evolving consumer preferences.",

Wage costs are also significant due to the labor-intensive nature of operating furniture showrooms and providing customer service. Incorporating technologies like augmented/virtual reality can help attract customers but requires investment.",
