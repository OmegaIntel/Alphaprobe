      "Competition is fierce as firms boast their abilities to provide insight and fulfill all of a client's needs. Competition is based on technical expertise, quality of service, availability of value-added services and price.",
      "Maintaining relationships improves the client base and boosts a company's reputation as well. Previous clients' work is relied on to obtain future business through referrals and recommendations.",
      "Shifting technology trends reshape the industry as the world becomes more technology-driven. Businesses across all industries have become reliant on external IT services.",
      "As more business is conducted online, the need for the cloud network and other industry services will provide a boost to the industry. Operators constantly modify the software they provide to customers to remain competitive.",
      "The five largest operators account for just over 5.0% of industry revenue. The sheer size of the industry and the services offered prevents a single company from dominating the industry.",
      "Many operators are small nonemployers or independent contractors, contributing to the industry's fragmentation. In addition, new entrants enter the industry in an attempt to capture market share.",
      "Intellectual property protects the products that operators create and is crucial to the profitability of the industry. Companies rely on patent, copyright, trademark and trade secret laws in the US.",
      "Industry associations provide many services to aid operators. Government relations, business development, corporate education and intellectual property protection are some areas of association assistance.",
      "Digital technology solutions that service all market sectors and new technology can improve profit. Clients continue to rely on digital technology solutions to drive business.",
      "Constant development in technology keeps market share concentration low as new entrants cater their services to niche markets. The industry remains fragmented because of the abundance of products and services offered.",
      "Regions with a cluster of financial services companies attract the services of the industry. New York being the financial capital of the world has directly benefited from industry services.",
      "Silicon Valley is one of the largest centers of high technology and requires the support from IT consultants to operate their businesses more efficiently. California is home to the largest amount of industry establishments.",
      "Computer systems development has enabled operators to expand services. On premise servers and storage devices increasingly help with managing information.",
      "Rising demand during and after the pandemic shows the importance of industry services and the need for them in all realms of business. IT Consultants have advanced data processing capabilities and regularly work on reducing the risk of identity theft through more secure security systems."
