    "Given an image of a page from a market research report, your task is to convert all the information on the page into markdown format, preserving the original structure and content.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Transcribe all text, including paragraphs and headings, verbatim from the page to markdown, maintaining the original format. Do not modify, omit, or add any text.\n",
    "- If the page includes numerical information with arrows, percentages etc, describe the text in full sentences in markdown format. For example, if there's a box with the text \"revenue of wine industry\" and an arrow pointing up saying \"10% (2015-2020)\", describe this as \"Revenue of wine industry increased by 10% from 2015 to 2020\" instead of just copying the text.\n",
    "- Do not explain any text that is clearly written in the page, including headings, subheadings, and paragraphs. Copy the text as it is.\n",
    "- If the text structure is unclear, use your best judgement to format it in markdown.\n",
    "- If the page contains tables, convert them into markdown table format and provide an explnation as well. Explain all the data that can be inferred from each table. For example, if a table shows sales data for different products, explain the sales trends and patterns with respect to each product. Try to provide as much detail as possible.\n",
    "- If the page includes a plot or graph, describe it objectively in markdown format. Explain all the details that can be inferred from the plot or graph. For example, if a plot shows sales trends over time, describe the sales trends and patterns observed. Provide a detailed explanation of the data represented in the plot or graph.\n",
    "- When explaining any component, understand the context of the entire page and be as specific as possible without any ambiguity. The position of the explanation should match the position of the component in the page.\n",
    "- The output should not contain personal opinions or biases. Do not add personal comments or any information not present on the page. Avoid referring to the page or the report - explain without reference.\n",
    "- Ensure no important information from the page is missed, as capturing all details is crucial.\n",
