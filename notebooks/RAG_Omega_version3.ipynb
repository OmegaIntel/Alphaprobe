Fuel efficiency is also a growing consideration for military applications where improved efficiency can mean longer mission times and reduced refueling requirements.\n",

            "When the global economic turndown struck, commercial passenger and cargo airlines were struck especially hard by reduced demand for passenger and cargo flights, and historically high fuel prices. In 2008, in perhaps the deepest part of the global economic turndown, fuel prices hit an all-time high that still has not been exceeded. Oil prices reached $155 per barrel in June 2008, then fluctuated between $85 and $115 through July 2014; this marked a significant increase from the oil prices of around $30 to $45 per barrel through most of the 1990s through 2004. A three-to-four-fold cost in fuel was especially difficult to bear in conjunction with reduced demand for air travel during the turndown. Ridership per plane fell off dramatically. Airlines were paying excessively high fuel prices to run flights with more seats than passengers, making profitability exceptionally difficult.\n",
            "\n",
            "In contrast, during the post-COVID economic restrictions, fuel prices dropped significantly and economic pressure to reduce fuel consumption and improve efficiency was, at least temporarily, lifted. Nonetheless, greenhouse gas (GHG) emission restrictions and goals have continued to drive demand for fuel efficiency, even without the same cost pressure on fuel.\n",

As discussed above, the global airline industry balanced its new strategies successfully by using a number of factors; part of the airlines' plan was to consolidate less profitable routes. The other part of their approach, which benefitted airplane manufacturers and supported aircraft demand for superalloys centered on increasing fuel efficiency. Only limited gains in fuel efficiency can be achieved by updating older technologies with new components. These may drive low single-digit percentage reductions in fuel costs. For more substantial improvements in fuel efficiency, whole system upgrades, that is, airplane replacement, were needed. The industry responded accordingly, resulting in an uptick in demand for high-efficiency planes. The industry has strived to meet that demand. Now, despite reduced purchases, commercial air carriers are still looking for efficient systems.\n",

            "Generally, improved efficiency comes through improved engine efficiency and reduced weight. At this point, jet engines are largely quite efficient, and updates using available technologies result in small incremental gains. Weight reduction, known as lightweighting, is therefore the primary frontier for improving fuel efficiency in planes. Lightweighting is a significant driver for the use of aerospace ceramics and composites in airplanes. These materials are stronger, with reduced weight profiles and improved performance, in comparison to conventional technologies. In fact, lightweighting continues to be the primary driver of advanced material incorporation into the global airplane industry. While market fundamentals in the airplane manufacturing industry are likely to see increased variability in the coming months and years, we expect to see a strong and continued push toward increased lightweighting.\n",

UAVs and drones are a great help when it comes to surveillance and defense in harsh environment conditions and difficult terrain. Since UAVs and drones often operate in extreme environments the materials they are made of should have high corrosion resistance. Composites can be manufactured using combinations of different materials, thereby giving the UAV or drone specific characteristics. For instance, composites can be designed to absorb certain frequency waves and transmit different frequencies. This can help these craft to avoid being detected on radar and thus avoid anti-air defense systems. These benefits make composites the preferred choice for UAV production. However, the small size of drones leads to less consumption of material when compared to fighter jets and rotorcraft So UAVs and drones contribute a smaller share to the aerospace ceramic market.\n",

Customers/buyers of these aircraft, such as commercial airlines, are expected to follow strict pollution norms which in turn impact the manufacturing process of the aircrafts. The manufacturers of commercial aircraft invest large sums in R&D on better materials to cope with the tightening regulations. The prime focus of these R&D activities is to develop lightweight materials with enough strength and stability so that they can replace existing heavy materials such as metals and alloys. The lighter structure helps to achieve higher fuel efficiency and lower emissions, thereby decreasing the expense of operations and increasing profit margin for operators.\n",

            "\n",
            "Commercial aircraft production is dominated by Boeing (U.S.) and Airbus (France). These two companies account for more than 90% of global commercial aircraft fleet. These companies have most of their operations located in their home countries. Thus, the aerospace ceramics market for commercial aerospace industry is concentrated in the U.S. and France.\n",

            "© 2021 | BCC Research LLC                  AVM218A Aerospace Ceramics: Global Markets to 2026 | 67Other key players in the commercial aerospace industry are Embraer (Brazil), Bombardier (Canada), Commercial Aircraft Corporation of China COMAC (China), and Cessna Aircraft (U.S.). As China recovered sooner than U.S. and European countries from COVID-19 shutdowns, COMAC was able to resume its aircraft production by the end of 2020. Thus, the demand for ceramics and composites for aerospace applications gained momentum in Asia before the developed regions.\n",
            "\n",
            "The global aircraft industry suffered significant losses due to COVID-19 shutdowns and decreased travel demand during 2020. The demand for commercial aircraft took a hit, dropping by ~40% compared to 2019. Boeing's deliveries dropped by 57% and those of Airbus dropped by 34%. Also, Boeing had to ground its 737 Max fleet due to technical issues in the sensor system. The order cancellations for Boeing and Airbus cascaded to the leading component manufacturers in the industry, impacting the demand for aerospace ceramics and composites in 2020. Though the commercial aircraft industry is showing signs of recovery, the backlog is still large enough to impact the new production orders of aircraft.\n",
            "\n",
            "Another factor that has an impact on the commercial aircraft industry is the revenue of airline companies. In 2020, the revenue per kilometer (RPK) dropped more than 65%, pulling down the profits of airlines over a steep slope.

The percentage share of military expenditure of global GDP increased sharply as there was a COVID-induced drop in global GDP but military expenditures remained constant. The leading countries in the global military market are the U.S., Russia, the U.K., China, and India. According to Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI), Africa registered the highest growth in military expenditure followed by Europe and North America during the year. The defense aerospace industry is estimated to follow the military expenditure graph closely, thereby growing in the same pattern. Like the commercial aerospace segment, most of the military aircraft production takes place in North America and Europe. Thus, the growing demand for military aircraft across the globe will subsequently drive the demand for ceramics and composites in North America and Europe during the forecast period.\n",

UAVs and drones are a great help when it comes to surveillance and defense in harsh environment conditions and difficult terrain. Since UAVs and drones often operate in extreme environments the materials they are made of should have high corrosion resistance. Composites can be manufactured using combinations of different materials, thereby giving the UAV or drone specific characteristics. For instance, composites can be designed to absorb certain frequency waves and transmit different frequencies. This can help these craft to avoid being detected on radar and thus avoid anti-air defense systems. These benefits make composites the preferred choice for UAV production. However, the small size of drones leads to less consumption of material when compared to fighter jets and rotorcraft So UAVs and drones contribute a smaller share to the aerospace ceramic market.\n",

The operating environment of space vehicles is extreme and much different than that of other aerospace segments. The materials used for spacecraft need to be able to sustain performance and shape in the presence of high radiation, friction from the atmosphere and landing impact. The exposure to radiation can trigger surface erosion in materials, which subsequently can result in structural damage.

With a decreased number of passengers and stricter safety regulations, the best way for commercial aerospace players to stem losses is to increase profit margins with available traffic. This puts the idea of increasing the fuel efficiency of aircraft in the spotlight. The primary solution to this is to reduce the weight of aerostructures by replacing heavy components (mostly metals) with lighter materials. Though the aerospace industry has already been investing significant money and effort into the development of lightweight materials, the hit from pandemic is expected to put these activities into high gear, thereby increasing the adoption of ceramics and composites in more structural applications in the aerospace industry. These developments will drive the demand for ceramics and composites during the forecast period.\n",

The company leads the ceramics and composites demand in the U.S. in the commercial aerospace segment. Boeing has been increasing the share of composites in its aircraft models over the years, leveraging their light weight and high-strength characteristics. In 2020, Boeing faced strong headwinds due to the grounding of its 737 Max, weaker demand for the 777X and the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. The company postponed its 777X production plans to 2022,Twhich will decrease the potential growth rate for ceramics in the commercial aerospace segment in the country.

The defense segment was not affected by COVID-19 as severely as the commercial segment. Indeed, the revenue of the top six military aircraft manufacturers in the country increased by 2% with increased foreign sales in 2020. Lockheed Martin, a leading manufacturer of military aircraft, saw a revenue increase of 9% due to increasing demand for its F-35. The company further plans to decrease the cost of F-35 to push the product demand higher in near future. Another key development in the defense segment was that in June 2021, Boeing successfully tested the MQ-21, a refueling UAV with U.S. Air Force. This drone UAV can transport fuel to fighter jets for midair fueling. For the UAV segment, China plays an important role as a leading supplier of composite components (fuselage), electric motors and PCSs to the U.S. The defense aerospace segment in the country will continue to be vibrant during the forecast period with the introduction of new aircraft, further development of UAVs and increasing demand for fighter jets around the globe.

Indeed, the revenue of the top six military aircraft manufacturers in the country increased by 2% with increased foreign sales in 2020. Lockheed Martin, a leading manufacturer of military aircraft, saw a revenue increase of 9% due to increasing demand for its F-35. The company further plans to decrease the cost of F-35 to push the product demand higher in near future. Another key development in the defense segment was that in June 2021, Boeing successfully tested the MQ-21, a refueling UAV with U.S. Air Force. This drone UAV can transport fuel to fighter jets for midair fueling. For the UAV segment, China plays an important role as a leading supplier of composite components (fuselage), electric motors and PCSs to the U.S. The defense aerospace segment in the country will continue to be vibrant during the forecast period with the introduction of new aircraft, further development of UAVs and increasing demand for fighter jets around the globe.

            "Japan's aerospace industry primarily started off with production of defense aircraft. Even now, the country manufactures some of the leading defense aircraft, such as the F-2 fighter, OH-1 observation helicopter, the T-4 and T-7 trainer, and the U.S.-2 search and rescue flying boat. However, the focus has shifted towards commercial and space vehicles over the last decade. The shift can be observed by increased employment and turnover of commercial aircraft and spacecraft segments. Japan plays a crucial role in the supply chain of leading commercial aircraft manufacturers Boeing and Airbus. The country plays a crucial role in production of the Boeing 767, 777, 777X, and 787; the Airbus A320, A330, A350 XWB, and A380; along with jet engines including the V2500, Trent1000, GEnx, GE9X, and PW1100G-JM. Japanese manufacturers contribute more than 20% of the main structural components of the Boeing 777X.\n",

            "Early aerospace materials focused on using the lightest metals available for airplane and rocket construction. It was the U.S.'s ability to quickly refine and separate large amounts of aluminum that helped the country manufacture airplanes rapidly during World War II. But perhaps the most significant early application for advanced aerospace materials in the industry centered on the construction of new types of engines. Engines subject to extreme heat and mechanical forces required the development of new metals and new alloys capable of withstanding extreme environments.\n",

            "In the period of 1900 to1910, the reliability of steel was greatly improved by a process called vacuum melting. This process enabled manufacturers to have closer control of elemental compositions, and also prevented the unintended incorporation of airborne nitrogen and oxygen into the still as it formed. These gases could become physically trapped in the metals, reducing their strength. Vacuum melting was also a critical process in enabling the addition and control of various refractory and other specialty elements such as aluminum, tantalum and niobium. It also allowed careful control of the alloy production process and enabled manufacturers to tune the composition of nickel, cobalt, chrome, molybdenum, aluminum, and other elements without nonmetallic impurities.\n",

            "Superalloys constituted the industry's first major new material-oriented advancement. The term \"superalloy\" came about in the mid-1940s to describe a group of recently invented alloys that could be used at exceptionally high temperatures, but that also maintain their strength, resistance and toughness at these high temperatures. These alloys were developed primarily in support of aircraft turbine engine development, which requires high performance under conditions of exceptionally high temperatures and high mechanical stress. These alloys maintained their strength almost wholly until they reached their melting points.\n",

            "The need for temperature-resistant metals or steel was strongly driven by advances during the late industrial revolution and its outgrowth of various products. Initially nickel, chromium and cobalt were added to iron and were considered high-temperatures alloys into the 1940s. Engineers, particularly those were in U.S and Europe, invented an array of high-temperature alloys that were used to meet existing and perceived future industrial needs. However, in order to transition from high-temperature alloys to superalloys a new production technology was necessary.\n",
            "\n",
            "Prior to the 1940s superalloys and their precursors found application primary in the manufacturing industry. Businessmen such as Elwood Haynes, an early automotive entrepreneur, sought to streamline, economize and speed up the automobile manufacturing process. This drive led to increasingly rapid machining, which ultimately was limited by cutting tools that would wear down rapidly, requiring frequent replacement. Demand surged for alloys that were able to withstand high temperatures while retaining their hardness. The solution came about as a cobalt-chrome alloy, which eventually evolved into vitallium (65% cobalt, 30% chromium, 5% molybdenum, and traces of other substances). Other new and highly resistance alloys being developed at that time included nickel-chromium alloys, cobalt-chromium alloys and iron-chromium-nickel alloys. These alloys targeted a range of applications including cutting tools for machines, alloys used for heating elements, internal combustion engine parts, steam turbine blades, pistons, and use in valves and valve components.\n",

            "By the 1940s and 1950s new airplane engine technology in the form of turbine engines became the principal driver for the development of superalloys and the superalloy production industry. As demand grew for increasingly durable alloys in the aircraft industry, high temperature and other early superalloy precursor metals gave way to the more common use of nickel- and cobalt-based superalloys. In this manner, gas turbine engine development and non-propeller engines in the aviation industry were founded on the heat resistant backbone of superalloys. Over the ensuing decades, superalloys found other applications, but the aircraft (and later the aerospace) industry remained the primary driver of the R&D and innovation encompassing the advancement of superalloys.\n",

            "In 1950 and 1951, the re-emergence of vacuum melting for superalloy production led to another round of substantial progress in superalloy development. At this time the significant benefits of vacuum melting were more wholly recognized. These advantages included the minimization of oxidation and potential for oxygen removal from the existing composition of the metal prior to its melting. Vacuum melting and degassing techniques permitted the use of highly active elemental additions such as titanium. At this time titanium- and aluminum-containing alloys for jet engines rapidly transitioned from air melting to vacuum melting production techniques, giving the alloys new and enhanced creep strength and consistency never before realized.\n",

These changes have come about from a continued demand for increased performance, reduced weight and strength with less bulk. Like the global automotive industry, the global aerospace industry is now undergoing a new round of significant material- and design-oriented upgrades focused largely on weight reduction. Reducing the weight of aerospace materials significantly reduces the amount of fuel needed to support operations. Over the last 20 years, this fact has become increasingly important not only to reduce the amount of money spent on fuel purchase, but also to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, which has become critical to many countries.
