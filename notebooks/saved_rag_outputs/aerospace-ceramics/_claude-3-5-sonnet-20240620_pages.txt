# Chapter 1: Introduction

The term ceramics primarily refers to material made of clay and which has limited applications such as for pottery and insulating material. However, today ceramics are developed through various production processes and different materials such as metals and non-metals to make them suitable for a wide range of industrial applications. These applications include automotive, electrical and electronics, biotechnology, and industrial manufacturing.

Ceramics are used in the aerospace industry due to their high thermal resistance, chemical stability, high hardness, and high vibration resistance. These materials are lighter than metals and provide better electrical insulation and energy ablation.

Aerospace applications can be segmented into three major categories: thermal, electrical and structural applications. The materials used are classified as oxides, non-oxides, glass ceramics, and ceramic matrix composites (CMCs). These ceramics are used in components of an aircraft that must have high compressive strength, such as engines and exhaust systems.

The COVID-19 pandemic had a negative impact on the commercial aerospace segment due to travel shutdowns, low passenger counts and high declining ratio in 2020. However, the defense aerospace segment was comparatively not heavily impacted as the untouched since purchase commitments were made well before the pandemic.

## Study Goals and Objectives

The goal of this study is to provide an up-to-date analysis of current and future markets for aerospace ceramics. The study provides a comprehensive accounting of worldwide aerospace ceramics markets. It presents a thorough and up-to-date global assessment of the market and business of aerospace ceramics. This, in turn, will help industry participants, suppliers and manufacturers make informed decisions needed to compete and succeed in the marketplace.

## Reasons for Doing This Study

Aircraft manufacturers are increasingly incorporating ceramics and composites into aircraft to reduce weight and increase fuel efficiency. Ceramics also help manufacturers cope with tightening emission norms across the globe. Companies are actively investing large amounts in research to develop better-performing ceramics and composites. This has put ceramics in the spotlight as a lucrative opportunity for stakeholders of the aerospace materials industry.

This study will help aerospace ceramics manufacturers, raw material suppliers, aircraft and component manufacturers, along with other stakeholders to stay abreast of the technology and the demand for it in the years ahead.

***Page 21***

# Chapter 3: Industry Trends and Opportunities

This chapter examines industry supply networks, significant industry organizations, and the trends in market dynamics and values for aerospace materials.

## Value Chain

Along with their material composition, aerospace materials have a distinct upstream supply chain. Ceramics or composites are used in these materials. Materials that are solely metal-based, for example, require distinct source materials (and hence require separate upstream supply networks). There is also a significant disparity in end consumers. The selling process drastically changes from client-to-client. For instance, the selling process for the defense projects run by the government is different from that with the civil aviation companies.

## Mineral Mining for Metals/Alloy Production

This category involved the extraction of ore-containing minerals from the earth. Large businesses mine major components such as nickel, cobalt, aluminum, titanium, and iron all over the world. BHP Billions Ltd., Rio Tinto, Fortescue Metals Group, Vale SA, MMC Norilsk Nickel, Jinchuan Group, Xstrata Plc, Freeport Cobalt, Glencore, and Umicore are among the major players. Large mining firms or specialist companies that target rare or small-volume metals may mine or separate other metals and alloy components as components of an ore targeted for another metal, or they will be independently mined.

Initial cleaning and separation processes are included in mineral extraction and mining to eliminate contaminants from the produced ore and minimize the volume of rejects carried to the next stage in the supply chain.

## Material Recyclers

Alloys, like metals, are highly recyclable, but recycling certain alloys is more difficult than recycling other forms of scrap metal. If recycled, alloys can be used once again. Non-target metals and other chemicals must be removed from recycled material before it can be used. The resultant materials are then injected into the metals/alloy supply chain, with metals often being recovered for purification and eventual reuse.

For composites, the recycling methods are as shown in the following figure:

[Note: The image does not contain the mentioned figure showing recycling methods for composites.]

## Composite Recycling Processes

The image presents a hierarchical flow chart depicting various composite recycling processes. The chart is organized as follows:

1. At the top level, "Recycling Methods" is the main category.
2. Under Recycling Methods, there are three main branches:
   - Mechanical
   - Thermal
   - Chemical
3. The Thermal branch further splits into three sub-categories:
   - Combustion
   - Fluidized-bed
   - Pyrolysis

This flow chart illustrates the different approaches to recycling composite materials, categorizing them into mechanical, thermal, and chemical methods. The thermal method is further elaborated, showing three specific processes: combustion, fluidized-bed, and pyrolysis. This visualization helps to understand the various techniques available for recycling composite materials and their hierarchical relationships.

The mechanical recycling process includes cutting the composite waste into small parts, while separating it from the structure. The thermal recycling of composites focuses on controlled combustion of composites to recover material with minimum damage possible. The chemical recycling process includes the conversion of polymers to monomers or partial depolymerization to oligomers as a result of chemical reaction. The polymer matrix in the waste composite is broken down by dissolving it in chemicals such as acids, bases and solvents. This method is mainly used for carbon-fiber reinforced polymer (CFRP).

# Table 1
## CFRP and Glass Fiber Recycling Process and Retained Tensile Strength

| CFRP Recycling | Retained Tensile Strength |
|-----------------|---------------------------|
| Mechanical | ~50%* |
| Fluidized-bed process | ~75% |
| Pyrolysis | 36–93%; typically, ~80% or less |
| Microwave-assisted pyrolysis | ~80% |
| Chemical | 90–98%; typically, ~95% or less |
| High-voltage fragmentation | ~83%** |

| Mechanical | ~78% |
| Fluidized-bed process | ~50% |
| Pyrolysis | ~52% |
| Microwave-assisted pyrolysis | ~52% |
| Chemical | ~58% |
| High-voltage fragmentation | ~88% |

Source: Journal Composite Science 2021

The table provides information on the retained tensile strength for various recycling processes of CFRP (Carbon Fiber Reinforced Polymer) and Glass Fiber. For CFRP recycling, mechanical processes retain about 50% of the tensile strength, while the fluidized-bed process retains approximately 75%. Pyrolysis shows a wide range of 36-93%, but typically retains around 80% or less. Microwave-assisted pyrolysis maintains about 80% of the tensile strength. Chemical processes are the most effective, retaining 90-98% of the strength, typically around 95% or less. High-voltage fragmentation retains about 83% of the tensile strength.

For Glass Fiber recycling, the retained tensile strength varies across different processes. Mechanical recycling retains about 78% of the strength, while the fluidized-bed process and pyrolysis both retain around 50-52%. Microwave-assisted pyrolysis also retains about 52% of the tensile strength. Chemical processes for glass fiber recycling are less effective compared to CFRP, retaining only about 58% of the strength. Interestingly, high-voltage fragmentation appears to be the most effective method for glass fiber, retaining approximately 88% of the tensile strength.

## Raw Materials Producers

Producers of raw materials take raw materials from the ground or create raw materials in various ways for the manufacture of new aeronautical materials. The minerals and ceramics basic materials utilized in composites and ceramics are the subject of this section. Mining and extraction of the mineral elements needed in the manufacturing of aeronautical materials are common operations. Producers of raw materials also create base materials for other sectors, such as ceramics, glass, and fiberglass, as well as other critical raw materials required for a range of end applications. It's worth noting that certain raw materials companies put a strong emphasis on recycling and recovering target materials from discarded or squandered resources. Raw materials producers operate in a commodities market, thus to some degree that standard prices can be calculated, within a margin of error.

## Petroleum Supply Chain

All upstream oil extraction and recovery, as well as transportation of crude oil, natural gas and other raw petroleum products to centralized refineries, storage and other raw natural resources management infrastructure and components are all part of the petroleum supply chain. The petroleum supply chain is a vital part of the resin and plastic manufacturing process, which includes resins and plastics used in aircraft composites. Furthermore, many types of petrochemicals serve as foundation materials for developing aircraft materials. The petroleum supply chain is completely commodified, and it is influenced by global geopolitical forces as well as conventional supply and demand factors.

***Page 24***

# Ore Concentration and Metal Extraction

Metals required for super alloy manufacturing are removed from their ore after mining. Depending on the metal and the characteristics and composition of the base material, the extraction process can take a variety of shapes. Compound ores are common in incoming ores, which implies that different metals may coexist in the same base rock. Cobalt, copper and nickel, for example, are frequently found combined in extracted ore. The ore body is crushed or pulverized during the concentration process, and then separated depending on an ore's specific gravity. This is generally done in water, with heavier target particles sinking first and lighter fines being discharged as tailings. Following concentration, the extraction process may entail further crushing or pulverizing, as well as heat and chemicals, to separate the target metal(s) from the surrounding rock. Other methods include electrorefining or direct smelting without the use of any chemicals. The ore concentration process can be done at the mine site, but the metal extraction procedure is usually done elsewhere. Depending on the target metal and local supply chain variations and features, concentration and extraction may be accomplished by the same business or by distinct companies.

## Intermediate Materials Producers

Intermediate materials producers frequently overlap with metal extractors. These producers coarsely remove impurities from extracted metals, such that the resulting material might be considered low purity aluminum, nickel, iron, or cobalt, or other metals or blends of metals with some level of residual contamination. However, some impurities remain in these materials in varying quantities.

## Metal Refineries

Metal refineries are where entering metals are purified into single metals. Various metals may be refined in refineries for limited volume, while higher-value metals are utilized in advanced alloy manufacturing. These include those required for super alloys. Large-scale metal refineries, such as those for aluminum, iron or nickel, may have dedicated facilities for these materials. In order to facilitate transportation to various metal refineries, metal refineries typically generate billets, ingots or other forms of their target metal. Metal refineries are also known as raw materials producers in product-oriented supply chains.

## Petrochemical Producers

Petrochemical producers include refiners and facilities downstream of the refining process that convert base/raw crude oil and other natural energy extractables into base chemicals and preliminary products. Petrochemical producers generate base materials, often through steam cracking and reforming, such as olefins (ethylene, propylene and butane), aromatics such as benzene, toluene and xylenes, and other chemicals. Petrochemical producers are also responsible for some of the base materials that are used by downstream chemical producers to manufacture and synthesize aerospace materials including composites.

## Intermediary Metallurgists/Forgers

This supply chain phase may be incorporated into specialized equipment or components manufacturers, as well as metal refiners in some circumstances, although it is not generally integrated into original equipment manufacturers (OEMs). Intermediary metallurgists follow a computer-guided procedure that includes one or more super alloy manufacturing processes. Intermediary metallurgists and forgers usually finish their advanced alloy process by shaping the metals into billets or other conventional shapes for transportation and delivery.

***Page 25***

# Aerospace Materials Manufacturers

Materials from the metals, petroleum and/or raw materials supply chains (including ceramics) are combined for the manufacture of basic materials utilized in the aerospace sector in this supply chain phase. This category can be up-or-down-integrated with other supply chain components, or it can be a stand-alone element for practical purposes.

## Parts Manufacturers

Component makers' main job is to turn raw aeronautical materials into functional parts, which can be done in a variety of ways. Manufacturers of parts may be physically distinct from the supply chain stages mentioned below, or they may work in tandem with intermediary metallurgists. They employ methods congruent with resin, composite and ceramic components production, as well as forgers or equipment makers. Manufacturers of target parts and other equipment components may employ powder metallurgy or other casting processes for alloys.

## OEMs

OEMs mix basic materials accessible from upstream supply chain elements with other parts available from other fabricators to create components utilized by specialist equipment makers or product manufacturers. Most OEMs create auxiliary equipment such as motors, pumps and actuators, rather than equipment that directly employs super alloys, in the context of superalloys. OEMs may create goods that downstream chain members may readily brand.

Whether or not intermediate rebranding occurs, a single OEM in the superalloy supply chain plays an important role in the fabrication of the fundamental functioning parts utilized in many types of aerospace applications. Typically, OEM selection is influenced by a mix of price and delivery schedule, especially when a number of prospective vendors meet minimum/adequate production criteria.

## Specialty Equipment Manufacturers

Specialty equipment manufacturers create specialist components for superalloy product lines. They have patents in their field of expertise. Some of the major specialist equipment manufacturers may also have overlap with companies in the midstream supply chain. Smaller equipment manufacturers focus on a single product line, relying on OEMs or other specialist equipment manufacturers to supply non-specialized components such as motors, actuators, pumps, gauges, and pipes. Many key functional components of equipment that uses sophisticated aircraft materials are manufactured by specialty equipment manufacturers. The quality and reliability of final goods are heavily reliant on the quality of these producers' products.

## Product Manufacturers

In the aerospace sector, product manufacturers play a complementary function to specialist equipment makers. They may rely on sophisticated materials to assist their manufacturing process, but the end goods that they produce under their business model may not be specifically specialized to be utilized just in the aerospace sector. When creating fire extinguishers for commercial jets, for example, a producer of fire extinguishers for the aerospace sector may rely on innovative lightweight materials. However, they may also make non-advanced materials fire extinguishers for use in other sectors.

***Page 26***

# End Users

The final owners or operators of a finished, produced product or system using advanced aeronautical materials are known as end users. End users are generally responsible for the final product's operation and use, including maintenance. This is common in the commercial airplane industry, where airlines typically manage their own maintenance process, as well as in the defense industry, though the defense industry may also rely on specialized contractors to fulfil these roles.

## Industry and Key Research Organizations

Globally, there are a number of industry organizations focused on developing new materials for the aerospace industry. These include component manufacturers along with others involved in the production and deployment of the technologies and applications under consideration in this study. Manufacturers, researchers, developers, standards developers, and others are all supported by the industry organizations.

# Key Market Opportunities

The following section summarizes key market opportunities in the global aerospace ceramics market.

## Global Airplane Industry Trends

Commercial air carriers, particularly those in the U.S., have historically followed patterns of boom-bust cycles. These were caused by volatility that was once considered to be foundational to the industry, where major and ongoing capital investments were needed to maintain working aircraft. Meanwhile, competition continued downward pressure on prices and revenue, leaving major air carriers strapped for cash during lean periods. However, a significant change occurred in the industry during the 2007 global economic turndown. At that time, profitability crashed in an unprecedented manner, as demand for air travel dropped, which led to a period of reorganization for the U.S. and global airline industry. Many consumers will recall a time of standard in-flight meals, more direct routes and planes flying below passenger capacity.

***Page 33***

That era ended during the recovery years, and airlines substantially revised their operational procedures, minimizing losses by lowering operating costs, reducing and eliminating unprofitable routes, and reducing reliance on older, less fuel-efficient aircraft. Significant mergers also took place, and flights suddenly became full, rather than having many open seats. Similar changes have taken place in commercial cargo markets, although these have focused on route optimization, consolidating lower profitability routes, and investing in planes with higher fuel efficiency and advanced technology.

In the wake of those industry-level changes, the U.S. and global airline industries had significantly transitioned their operating structure to support more consistent profitability. Many global air carriers maintained profitable operation following their restructuring efforts in the wake of that global economic turndown. Industry analysts forecast stable profitability for the foreseeable future, which was generally anticipated until the onset of COVID-19.

COVID-19 has injected instability into the system and is expected to result in a temporary crash in travel demand that will last 12 to 24 months. As a result, airlines will be less able to invest in new equipment, and purchase of new planes will likely be greatly reduced until 2022 or even 2023. In addition, economic restructuring will likely result in reduced travel demand. As a result, we expect to see a slowing of markets. In comparison to the intermediary period between the global economic turndown and the onset of COVID-19 the industry could see significant restructuring as a growing number of would be travelers have sought to reduce their reliance on traditional in-person meetings that require travel, particularly in the business sector.

## Efficiency and Fuel Cost

Today's commercial aircraft are more efficient than ever, leveraging continual advances in superalloy technology. Today's jet turbines can burn hotter and more efficiently than their predecessors. This shift to hotter burning engines has helped to drive continued R&D in the superalloy industry while contributing to greater demand for advanced and aerospace materials such as ceramics and composites. Silicon carbide (SiC) is currently in enjoying the limelight from engine manufacturers for its applications in hot engine sections. Fuel efficiency is also a growing consideration for military applications where improved efficiency can mean longer mission times and reduced refueling requirements.

When the global economic turndown struck, commercial passenger and cargo airlines were struck especially hard by reduced demand for passenger and cargo flights, and historically high fuel prices. In 2008, in perhaps the deepest part of the global economic turndown, fuel prices hit an all-time high that still has not been exceeded. Oil prices reached $155 per barrel in June 2008, then fluctuated between $85 and $115 through July 2014; this marked a significant increase from the oil prices of around $30 to $45 per barrel through most of the 1990s through 2004. A three-to-four-fold cost in fuel was especially difficult to bear in conjunction with reduced demand for air travel during the turndown. Ridership per plane fell off dramatically. Airlines were paying excessively high fuel prices to run flights with more seats than passengers, making profitability exceptionally difficult.

In contrast, during the post-COVID economic restrictions, fuel prices dropped significantly and economic pressure to reduce fuel consumption and improve efficiency was, at least temporarily, lifted. Nonetheless, greenhouse gas (GHG) emission restrictions and goals have continued to drive demand for fuel efficiency, even without the same cost pressure on fuel.

***Page 34***

Prior to COVID-19, the industry had been in a period of replacing airplanes with more fuel-efficient models. As discussed above, the global airline industry balanced its new strategies successfully by using a number of factors; part of the airlines' plan was to consolidate less profitable routes. The other part of their approach, which benefitted airplane manufacturers and supported aircraft demand for superalloys centered on increasing fuel efficiency. Only limited gains in fuel efficiency can be achieved by updating older technologies with new components. These may drive low single-digit percentage reductions in fuel costs. For more substantial improvements in fuel efficiency, whole system upgrades, that is, airplane replacement, were needed. The industry responded accordingly, resulting in an uptick in demand for high-efficiency planes. The industry has strived to meet that demand. Now, despite reduced purchases, commercial air carriers are still looking for efficient systems.

Generally, improved efficiency comes through improved engine efficiency and reduced weight. At this point, jet engines are largely quite efficient, and updates using available technologies result in small incremental gains. Weight reduction, known as lightweighting, is therefore the primary frontier for improving fuel efficiency in planes. Lightweighting is a significant driver for the use of aerospace ceramics and composites in airplanes. These materials are stronger, with reduced weight profiles and improved performance, in comparison to conventional technologies. In fact, lightweighting continues to be the primary driver of advanced material incorporation into the global airplane industry. While market fundamentals in the airplane manufacturing industry are likely to see increased variability in the coming months and years, we expect to see a strong and continued push toward increased lightweighting.

## Rotary/Helicopter Markets

The markets for advanced materials for helicopter/rotary applications are strongly dependent on helicopter-related market demand factors. To this end, the commercial helicopter market is disparate from commercial passenger and cargo aircraft markets and is driven by wholly different global market trends and influencing factors.

Large segments of the global helicopter market are supported by offshore industrial operations, particularly operations relating to the oil and gas industries. After a period of relatively high demand for offshore explanation and development when oil prices were high, the July 2014 drop in oil prices brought that surge in demand to a crash. Lower prices are founded on increased global oil supplies, especially in North America, combined with slower than expected economic performance in many parts of the world, including Asia-Pacific and Europe. While recent OPEC actions to reduce the supply have buoyed oil prices marginally, they are not yet at a point where additional exploration and development of costly offshore resources are economically viable. Offshore demand for helicopters is expected to continue to slide for the next several years, as existing projects wind down, with a slow replacement rate consistent with challenging offshore development and operations economics. Offshore operations continued to sputter for the following several years before the oil price crash of 2020 greatly reduced offshore profitability.

The industry has also suffered increased safety-related scrutiny in recent years. Several well-publicized helicopter failures and crashes resulted in fatalities, which has left helicopter OEMs struggling to shore up safety-related issues, along with their reputations.

© 2021 | BCC Research LLC                     AVM218A Aerospace Ceramics: Global Markets to 2026 | 26
***Page 35***

The decreased offshore demand was compensated to a small extent by increased demand for onshore applications in civil deployments including emergency medical service (EMS), as well as perhaps police or surveillance. Select EMS markets have seen growth, notably in Asia-Pacific, where industry growth has been in the low- to mid-single digits. Nonetheless, these numbers are restricted in scope, and key prospective markets like China continue to be hampered by airspace restrictions that limit civil helicopter activity and utilization, thereby impacting the ceramics markets.

Another key factor influencing the market is a lack of demand for replacement. Lower-flying helicopters, unlike aircraft, are not generally pressurized and are not subject to the same stress cycles. As a result, an old helicopter may be rebuilt several times by the manufacturer and restored to duty as refurbished. Fuel economy is what drives replacement components for helicopters that see a lot of use. Fuel economy is closely related to carbon emissions, which are subject to increasingly strict controls across the world, but particularly in European markets. Fuel costs also promote fuel efficiency-related replacement for highly utilized helicopters; however, the strength of this demand has waned since mid-2014 as fuel prices have moderated. Fuel costs are also less of a concern for helicopters that are only used sometimes, such as those used by police and EMS.

## Military Markets

Government allocations drive the global military markets for aerospace equipment. These can change as a result of leadership changes, shifting leadership priorities, and shifting global security conditions. Spending on military jets in the United States, which is by far the largest contributor to global defense spending, was steady from 2013 to 2016, with a 1% to 3% increase or decline year on year. Then, during the Trump administration, spending skyrocketed. Other countries, particularly China, have increased military spending, however much of this has occurred outside of the aerospace industry.

Advances in military spending in the U.S. budget advanced under Trump. However, it is expected that U.S. spending will fall as a percentage of total global military spending in the long run. This will be due to increased military spending abroad, particularly by China, which has already significantly raised its military budget and will most likely maintain or further expand (and maybe greatly enlarge) that budget in the near- to mid-term. This could shift military markets for jet engines toward China, although based on current development rates and public planning, major shifts are not expected during the five-year forecast period. However, the impact of such spending on outside markets remains unclear. China has now set up its own state-run aircraft engine maker, which may see the bulk of China's market value in the future, assuming that it can get its engines off the ground.

## Space Industry

As enterprises, governments, and, increasingly, investors look to the future, the space industry has achieved unprecedented visibility. Over the next two decades, global leaders such as SpaceX, Boeing, Virgin, and numerous worldwide government-funded programs are likely to display a considerable interest in space. Currently, however, despite tremendous innovation, commercial volumes remain small, only a tenth of that of the commercial airplane sector. Furthermore, currently existing space industry equipment is built on a piece-by-piece basis by only a few companies. This equipment is not mass-produced. As a result, while many new and technologically intriguing breakthroughs are emerging from the industry, and more are sure to follow, markets are not yet ready. We do not expect a big increase in global space industry market volume for at least three to five years.

It compares their melting points, densities, strengths, coefficients of thermal expansion (CTE), thermal conductivities (TC), and elastic moduli.

Beryllium oxide has the highest melting point (2530°C), thermal conductivity (210 W/m.K), and elastic modulus (400 GPa) among the listed ceramics. Zirconia and Silicon carbide share the second-highest melting point (2700°C). Zirconia has the highest density (5.6 g/cm³) and CTE (10.5 × 10⁻⁶/°C). Alumina shows the highest strength (455 MPa). Boron carbide has the lowest density (2.5 g/cm³) but the second-highest elastic modulus (450 GPa). Silicon nitride has the lowest CTE (3 × 10⁻⁶/°C) and second-lowest TC (17 W/m.K). Aluminum nitride has a relatively high TC (180 W/m.K) compared to most other ceramics in the table.

## Oxides

Oxide ceramics are compounds of oxygen and metallic or metalloid elements. The common metallic components are aluminum, zirconium, titanium, and magnesium, while silicon is the most widely used metalloid component in the oxide ceramics. These materials have a range of electrical properties and high melting points with low wear resistance. Among the oxide ceramics, alumina and zirconia are the most popular ceramics in aerospace industry.

## Alumina

Alumina ceramics (Al₂O₃), also known as aluminum oxide ceramics, are mostly manufactured applying the Bayer process on bauxite. The Bayer process takes place in four steps which involve use of caustic soda at high temperatures. The process yields alumina in form of hard white powder.

Alumina ceramics show high electrical insulation, thermal stability, flexural strength, and hardness along with wear resistance and corrosion resistance. These ceramics are the most widely used ceramics among the technical ceramics. Alumina supports different manufacturing processes such as uniaxial (die) pressing, slip casting, isostatic pressing, injection molding, and extrusion. More options to shape alumina make it easier for component manufacturers to cater to demand for a variety of components.

These ceramics primarily cater to the demand for ceramics in electrical applications in the aerospace industry. Alumina is used to manufacture products such as resistors, capacitors and sensors, which need to maintain their performance even at high temperatures. It is also used as a key component in various ceramic composites used in other applications such as thermal barrier coatings (TBC) and thermal protection systems (TPS). However, due to its low thermal shock resistance and low toughness these ceramics cannot sustain instant changes in temperature. Thus, alumina ceramics are mostly used in combinations with other ceramics or materials in thermal applications.

# Zirconia

Zirconia ceramics are also called zirconium oxide (ZrO₂). They are derived from a naturally occurring mineral baddeleyite with composition as zirconium dioxide. Zirconia can also be obtained by chemically treating zircon. The manufacturing process options for zirconia include thermal dissociation, fusion decomposition of zircon sand and chlorination of zircon. Zirconia can be processed with injection molding, precision grinding and laser cutting. Injection molding is preferred for bulk production of zirconia components.

These ceramics are characterized by the highest fractural toughness and flexural strength at room temperature when compared with all other aerospace ceramics. Other key properties of zirconia are high coefficient of thermal expansion, low thermal conductivity and high corrosion resistance. These characteristics made zirconia a preferred choice for TBC material.

In most of its applications, zirconia is used in its partially stabilized form. This is because, at high temperatures, zirconia has a tendency to undergo significant volume changes resulting from thermal phase transformation. Each phase of zirconia has different melting points. Thus, the change in phase during operation makes the component vulnerable to damage.

# Table 6
## Zirconia Phase and Melting Point

| Zirconia Phase | Melting point |
|-----------------|---------------|
| Monoclinic, baddeleyite | 20 –1,170°C |
| Tetragonal | 1,170 –2,370°C |
| Cubic | 2,370 –2,700°C |

Source: Matmatch

The table shows the melting points for different zirconia phases. Monoclinic baddeleyite has the lowest melting point range of 20 to 1,170°C. The tetragonal phase has a higher melting point range of 1,170 to 2,370°C. The cubic phase has the highest melting point range of 2,370 to 2,700°C.

To prevent this damage zirconia is stabilized with additives such as magnesium oxide, yttrium oxide and calcium oxide. Among the stabilizers for doped zirconia ceramics, yttrium oxide stabilized zirconia (Y2O3-ZrO2) is popular in the aerospace industry and referred as YSZ.

The combination in which yttrium oxide constitutes 7% by weight of YSZ is called 7YSZ and it is the widely used in thermal and structural applications of aerospace. 7YSZ plays a crucial role in the thermal barrier coating for aerospace engines. The reason such partially stabilized zirconia has been in practice for many decades now is because it withstands more thermal cycles than the fully stabilized zirconia.

Zirconia is also used in combination with other oxide and non-oxide ceramics to obtain a composite with higher performance characteristics compared to individual ceramics. Addition of zirconia in a composite is mostly intended to increase fracture toughness, hardness and strength of final material. One of the key composites of zirconia is Zirconia Toughened Alumina (ZTA). The composition includes zirconia in the range of 10-20% by wt. By changing the quantity of zirconia in ZTA properties such as mechanical strength and wear resistance can be adjusted as per the requirement of application. This makes ZTA a suitable choice for a cost-performance trade-off between alumina and zirconia.

# Non-oxides

Non-oxide ceramics are used applications where oxide ceramics are not compatible with the operating environment or not able to meet expectations. Most popular among these non-oxide ceramics are carbides, nitrides and borides.

## Silicon Carbide

Silicon carbide (SiC) ceramics are among the most popular ceramics being studied and used in aerospace applications. SiC can be produced using reaction bonding and sintering. The selection of the production process affects the end structure of SiC ceramics. The industrial production process of SiC involves electrochemical reaction between silica (SiO2) and carbon at high temperature. SiC-based components are manufactured using different processes including hot pressing, sintering, reaction sintering, CVD, and silicon-carbon-fiber-reinforcing.

Key characteristics of SiC ceramics are low dielectric loss, low density, high strength, oxidation resistance, excellent thermal shock resistance, low thermal expansion, and high thermal conductivity. SiC ceramics and composites are used in electronic component manufacturing for aerospace applications. These components help the industry achieve the same performance as silicon-based components at higher operating temperatures. SiC MOSFETs have been observed to provide double power density with much smaller and lighter packaging than the existing MOSFETs. Thus, their popularity and demand are increasing in the aerospace industry.

# Composites

Composites in aerospace applications are comprised of three product categories: fiber-reinforced polymers (FRP), metal matrix composites (MMC) and ceramic matrix composites (CMC). FRPs are characterized by high strength, stiffness and low density; however, they are subject to thermal and chemical degradation at high temperatures. For example, carbon FRP starts undergoing structural degradation at 3,000°C. MMCs and CMCs are suitable for high-temperature operations where FRPs tend to fail.

CMCs are used in components subject to high temperatures such as engine combustor inlets and exhaust nozzles. The components made of woven CMCs enable aircraft engines to operate at high temperatures without the need for cooling systems. Another application is aircraft brakes where the operating temperature can go up to 1,200°C. Carbon fiber-reinforced silicon carbide is preferred in brakes due to its high coefficient of friction, high strength and resistance to oxidation. The CMCs are also used in antennas and other electronic equipment.

The ceramic composites used in the aerospace industry are mostly based on glass and carbon. Materials such as ceramic and glass are brittle by nature. Thus, they are reinforced with other material fibers to gain toughness and strength. The reinforcement materials can be metals or non-metals such oxide and non-oxide ceramics.

## Table 13
### Comparison between Metals and Composites

| Materials | Strength | Drawback |
|-----------|----------|----------|
| Metals (aluminum alloys) | • Standardization and reparability<br>• Static behavior<br>• Improvement potential | • High material density<br>• Fatigue- and corrosion-related problems<br>• High costs of new alloys |
| Composites (CFRP) | • Fatigue behavior<br>• Low density and no corrosion<br>• Best suited for light-weight structures | • Poor Impact behavior<br>• No plasticity<br>• Reparability and recycling |

Source: BCC Research

The table compares the strengths and drawbacks of metals (specifically aluminum alloys) and composites (CFRP - Carbon Fiber Reinforced Polymer) in aerospace applications. Metals have advantages in standardization, reparability, and potential for improvement, but suffer from high density, fatigue and corrosion issues, and high costs for new alloys. Composites, on the other hand, excel in fatigue behavior, low density, and suitability for lightweight structures, but have poor impact behavior, lack plasticity, and face challenges in reparability and recycling.

Glass ceramics are an important part of structural applications in the aerospace industry for components such as sensors, displays, control system interactions, and solid oxide fuel cells. These ceramics find applications in canopies, windows, lenses, lighting, and panels. Glass ceramics with high transparency, high temperature stability, shock resistance, and light weight are always in demand from the aerospace industry.

Another form of glass ceramics used in aerospace industry is reinforcing fibers. Glass can be incorporated with high-performance fibers to attain higher strength and toughness. High-modulus ceramic materials are reinforced with materials with low-modulus materials in the matrix, thereby balancing the structural properties of the final material.

***Page 50***

These materials have elastic moduli range from 210 to 710 GPa while that of glass and glass composites range from 60 to 85 GPa. Also, some composites of glass can withstand temperatures as high as 1,200°C. The high elastic modulus and high operating temperature stability helps glass ceramic components maintain structural integrity under high extreme environments.

The manufacturing process of glass fiber-reinforced polymer (GFRP) ceramics includes five steps: batching, melting, fiberization, coating, and drying and packaging. GFRP has high strength-to-weight ratio so it plays a key role in structural applications in the aerospace industry. The production cost of this material is much less compared to the competitor materials such as carbon fiber-reinforced materials. The GFRP-based products can be manufactured using methods such as sheet molding compound (SMC)/bulk molding compound (BMC), open mold, resin transfer molding (RTM), continuous processing, pipes and tanks, glass mat-reinforced thermoplastics (GMT)/long fiber-reinforced thermoplastics (LFT).

Another important composite based on glass is glass-fiber-reinforced aluminum alloy, also known as glass and aluminum-reinforced epoxy (GLARE). This material is characterized by excellent fatigue resistance, high corrosion resistance and less density, making it a better choice as an alternate material compared to aluminum alloys in structural applications. For instance, GLARE components weigh 15% to 30% less than comparable aluminum alloy components.

The table presents data on leading commercial aircraft models and their use of composite materials. It shows the percentage by weight of composites used in various aircraft models from two major manufacturers, Airbus and Boeing. 

For Airbus, the use of composites ranges from 4.5% in the A300 model to 53% in the A350 model, showing a significant increase in composite usage across newer models. The A380, a large passenger aircraft, uses 25% composites by weight.

Boeing's aircraft models show a similar trend, with older models like the B747 using only 1% composites, while the newest model, the B787, incorporates 50% composites by weight. The B777, which falls in between, uses 11% composites.

This data indicates a clear trend towards increased use of composite materials in newer aircraft models for both manufacturers, with the most recent models (A350 and B787) having the highest percentage of composites by weight.

Carbon fiber-reinforced polymer ceramics play a crucial role in today's aircraft structure. CFRP-based products can be manufactured by molding, thereby enabling production of complex components. These components provide better mechanical performance than almost all other materials. The growing share of composites in aircraft is mostly due to increasing use of GFRP and CFRP in structural applications. Composites are used to build complex light-weight structures in drones and airplanes. The lower weight enables airlines to increase their profit margin through fuel efficiency.

Over the last decade, the demand for CFRP has grown 300% due to its growing use in the aerospace industry. As of 2020, the global production capacity of carbon fibers exceeds 150 kilotons per annum and aerospace accounts for the largest share in consumption led by Boeing and Airbus. The Asia-Pacific region has the largest share in the manufacture of CFRP as most manufacturers are headquartered in Asian countries, while the demand in aerospace applications is concentrated in North America and Europe.

The following table lists the top companies with their production facilities for precursor and CFRP in 2014.

The characteristic of specific heat measures the amount of heat required to increase the temperature of a unit mass material by one degree Celsius. This particular property of a material helps in understanding the difficulty of raising the temperature of a material. The higher the specific heat, the more difficult it is to raise the temperature of a material.

Thermal shock means a drastic change in temperature. Such changes cause non-uniform heat distribution, resulting in wear and tear due to irregular heat expansion and contraction in the material. Thus, a material with high thermal shock resistance becomes crucial in maintaining structural stability of a component.

Phase stability is the degree to which a material undergoes physical changes as a response to pressure and temperature changes. Many materials with initially high thermal stability tend to perform otherwise under high pressure environment. In aerospace applications, such change in properties could be disastrous.

Ceramics, compared to most metals, provide a very good combination of the above-mentioned characteristics. They have very low CTE, high specific heat and low thermal conductivity. The main reason for such characteristics is the strong interatomic bonds in ceramic materials. These materials have ionic-covalent bonding with no free electrons to transfer heat or electricity through the material. Thus, ceramics tend to provide excellent thermal insulation even in a high-pressure environment.

Thermal applications of ceramics in aerospace primarily refers to thermal barrier coatings (TBCs) in engine and exhaust systems in aerospace vehicles. Other applications include thermal protection systems for structures for exhaust cones, insulating tiles for the space shuttle and missile nose cones.

In aerospace engines, TBCs help the engine operate at higher temperatures and decrease the need for additional cooling systems. Thus, they increase fuel efficiency and generate overall cost benefits for end-users as well as reduce emissions. The most popular material used in TBCs is yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ). This is formulated by stabilizing zirconia (ZrO₂) with yttrium oxide (Y₂O₃).

A general TBC consists of two layers, a zirconia coat and a metallic bond coat. Some of the popularly used metallic bond coat composition are NiCrAlY, NoCoCrAlY, CoNiCrAlY, and PtAl. This coat is applied between the metal substate of the component and the ceramic coat to hold them both together. In addition, the bond coat protects the substrate from oxidation during operation.

# Figure 12
## Thermal Barrier Coating Structure

The figure illustrates the structure of a Thermal Barrier Coating. It consists of four layers, from top to bottom:

1. Thermal Barrier Coating: The topmost layer, appearing as a thick, speckled section.
2. Thermally Grown Oxide: A thin layer beneath the Thermal Barrier Coating.
3. Metallic Bond Coat: Another thin layer below the Thermally Grown Oxide.
4. Substrate: The bottom-most layer, serving as the base.

The image provides a clear visual representation of how these layers are arranged in a thermal barrier coating system, showing their relative thicknesses and positions.

Source: BCC Research

A third coat named the thermally grown oxide coat (TGO) forms between the bond coat and TBC as a result of artificial or operational oxidation. The artificially or intentionally grown TGO (Al₂O₃) on the bond coat acts as an adhesive medium for the TBC. The TGO can be produced with increasing operational temperature and results in uneven thickness across the surface. This causes coating failure at the interface between other coats.

Among the ceramics and composites, silicon carbide (SiC/SiC composites) is a popular choice for engine component manufacturing. These materials are estimated to need 20% less cooling air thus increasing the efficiency of engines. GE Aviation has invested large amounts in development of SiC-based CMC materials for thermal and structural applications in the aerospace industry. New GE engines are designed with an increased share of SiC composites in the composition of structures. SiC composites when compared to nickel-based alloys provide low density, higher temperature capability, and resistance to oxidation and corrosion.

Another thermal application of ceramics in aerospace are thermal protection systems (TPS) for spacecraft and hypersonic aircraft. TPS protects from high and low temperatures in the operating environments of aerospace vehicles. A space vehicle surface must deal with very high temperatures while travelling through the atmosphere but faces very low temperatures when in space.

TPS act as heat shield for aircraft and protect the vehicles. TPS used in reusable launch vehicles is expected to maintain inner temperature of around 200°C while facing high external temperatures ranging from 600°C to 1,650°C.

## Composite in Spacecraft

The image displays a cross-sectional view of a space shuttle, illustrating different composite materials used in its construction. The shuttle is shown in a side profile, with various sections colored to represent different materials. The color-coded legend identifies five types of materials:

1. Reinforced Carbon-Carbon Coating (dark red)
2. High-temperature Reusable Surface Insulation Tile (blue)
3. Low-temperature Reusable Surface Insulation Tile (yellow)
4. Advanced Flexible Reusable Surface Insulation Blanket (green)
5. Flexible Reusable Surface Insulation Blanket (light blue)

The shuttle's nose cone and leading edges of the wings are shown in dark red, indicating the use of Reinforced Carbon-Carbon Coating in these high-heat areas. The body of the shuttle is a mix of blue, yellow, green, and light blue sections, representing the various types of insulation tiles and blankets used to protect different parts of the spacecraft during reentry. The image also shows "United States" written on the side of the shuttle.

Ceramics have high energy of ablation, which makes them durable and reusable under the high-temperature environment faced by space vehicles during reentry. For example, with ablation properties, the ceramic layer on the external surface of a space shuttle melts away or shades off after reaching a specific temperature. This prevents transfer of heat from one layer to another, thus keeping the inner side cooler as compared to the external surface.

The materials used in TPS generally include fibers of various types of ceramics such as silica, alumina, zirconia, and alumina-borosilicate (ABS) and advanced material such as CMCs (mostly carbon-based) and phenolic resin-impregnated graphite fibers. Reinforced carbon-carbon composite (RCC) is one of the trending materials in aerospace TPS materials. It acts as a radiator to transmit heat from hot surfaces to cool areas of the structure. This helps to mitigate heat stress across the structure.

# Electrical Applications

Some of the key characteristics taken into consideration while selecting material for electrical applications in the aerospace industry are volume resistivity, dielectric strength, dielectric loss, and dielectric constant.

Volume resistivity represents the degree to which a material resists the flow of electrons within itself when a specific voltage is applied across the material. For most materials, volume resistivity changes under high pressure and high temperature conditions. Ceramics tend to sustain their volume resistivity even under harsh conditions. Thus, their demand is consistently increasing for electrical applications in the aerospace industry.

***Page 67***

Ceramics have high dielectric strength, which means they can maintain electric resistance over a wide range of voltages. Dielectric loss refers to the dissipation of dielectric energy by materials, which generally takes the form of heat. This heat can interfere with the performance of parts that surround an electric device. Ceramics generate a very low dielectric loss during their operational life, thus are a suitable choice for electric applications.

Ceramics are characterized by inherent high electrical insulation along with piezoelectric and dielectric functions. A typical aircraft has a high number of electronic components such as antennas, capacitors, resistors, and sensors. These products are susceptible to electronic interface during their operation. Ceramics used in these products support them in maintaining normal operations by prohibiting electrical interface.

The piezoelectric applications include ceramic materials to generate electricity directly proportional to the pressure experienced. Also, this function is reversible, which means when a voltage is applied to the material, it undergoes dimensional changes. This function makes piezoelectric ceramics suitable for multiple applications in aerospace industry such as fuel tank sensors.

In electrical applications there are other materials such as rubber, polymers and glass that can be considered as alternatives to ceramics. However, ceramics outperform these materials in terms of chemical and thermal resistance, making them a suitable choice for aerospace applications.

## Structural Applications

The materials for structural applications in the aerospace industry are selected by considering mechanical properties such as hardness, elastic modulus, density, and compressive strength. All these properties refer to the response of a material to stress and strain experienced during operation, except density. The ability to maintain physical dimensions and structural integrity under extreme environment plays a crucial role for components in aerospace structures.

Hardness is the property of resisting structural damage as a response to indentation or abrasion. Elastic modulus is similar to hardness but refers to temporary deformity under stress and strain. High elastic modulus means the material has high resistance to dimensional changes when stress is applied. Compressive strength is the property of a material to withstand forces applied to reduce its size. Density is mass per unit of volume, thus making it inversely proportional to weight. Lower density of a material enables the fabrication of products with less weight than those made from high-density materials.

The table presents a comparison of various aerospace materials, including metal alloys and composites, in terms of their Ultimate Tensile Strength (MPa), Young Modulus (GPa), and Density (g/cm³). 

Among the alloys, INCONEL x-750 and NIMONIC 80A show the highest Ultimate Tensile Strength at 1,250 MPa, while 6063 has the lowest at 241 MPa. NIMONIC 80A also has the highest Young Modulus at 222 GPa, with AZ31C-F and AZ61A-F having the lowest at 45 GPa. In terms of density, INCONEL x-750 is the heaviest at 8.28 g/cm³, while AZ31C-F is the lightest at 1.77 g/cm³.

For the composites, Carbon fiber reinforced epoxy resin (unidirectional) outperforms Glass fiber reinforced epoxy resin (unidirectional) in all three parameters. It has a higher Ultimate Tensile Strength (1,550 MPa vs 965 MPa), higher Young Modulus (137.8 GPa vs 39.3 GPa), and lower density (1.55 g/cm³ vs 1.85 g/cm³).

Comparing alloys to composites, the Carbon fiber reinforced epoxy resin has a higher Ultimate Tensile Strength than any of the alloys, while also having a significantly lower density. This demonstrates the potential advantages of composite materials in aerospace applications where high strength and low weight are crucial.

Ceramic matrix composites, zirconia and silicon carbide provide excellent structural stability under intense engine heat and high operating pressure. These materials also reduce the weight of components approximately by 50%. This reduced weight directly influences the fuel efficiency of aerospace vehicles. Over the years, the share of composites in the total materials used in an aircraft has increased drastically. The ease of manufacturing smaller and complex components by molding composites provides a competitive edge over their metal alternatives in production of UAVs. Also, airline industry leaders Boeing and Airbus have been investing to a great extent in R&D for lightweight materials. Currently these research activities are focused on composites with ceramics being an integral part of the composition.

# Environmental Barrier Coatings

SiC and SiC-based composites are considered the top competitors among the ceramic materials that are replacing metals in the aerospace industry. These materials are known for their excellent oxidation resistance, low density and high strength. However, when silicon comes in contact with water vapor during operation, its reaction results in gaseous silicon hydroxide (Si(OH)₄). This causes loss of SiO₂ protective silica and a drop in mechanical strength of the component.

Following is the chemical reaction equation of the process:

SiO₂ + 2 H₂O (gas) = Si(OH)₄ (gas)

To prevent such phenomenon, manufacturers have added a new coating called the environmental barrier coating (EBC). These coatings are made up of a mullite-based bond coat or a rare earth disilicate-based bond coat comprising at least three and two layers. Mullite and rare earth disilicates generally have high melting points (~1,800°C). The rare earth silicates used are primarily erbium, yttrium, ytterbium, and lutetium. These coatings are expected to protect SiC materials from recession and degradation while they lack thermochemical resistance to corrosion. This makes it difficult to achieve the result in jet engine applications.

NASA has been developing advanced EBCs to increase the efficiency of SiC-based components. The advanced EBCs used by NASA include HfO2- and ZrO₂-RE₂O₃-SiO₂ EBC systems with HfO₂-Si and rare earth-silicon bond coat systems. These combinations have allowed NASA to achieve heat stability, creep strength, high toughness, and increased erosion resistance. The growing demand for CMCs in aerospace applications will increase the need for EBCs as well, thereby driving the market for ceramics used in EBC production.

# Chapter 6: Market Breakdown by Segment

In this report the aerospace industry is broken down into three segments: commercial, defense and space. The commercial segment refers to aircraft manufactured to cater to demand from airlines, along with business jets, private jets and cargo planes. The defense segment includes aircraft such as fighter jets, unmanned air vehicles (UAV) and drones. Unmanned air vehicles are aircraft that are programmed to operate/fly by themselves while drones are operated manually from remote distances. Spacecraft are designed to be capable of transporting people as well as materials to space.

The commercial aerospace segment accounts for the largest share of the market due to the use of composites to replace metals and alloys in airline vehicles. In the defense segment, though fighter jets are increasingly using composites, the prime driver is exponentially-growing demand from UAVs and drones. Apart from defense, drones are also becoming very popular in other industries as well, such as building and construction, agriculture, and photography.

# Commercial Aerospace Industry

The commercial aerospace segment can be further classified into three sub-segments: passenger, transport (cargo), and business or private. Among these the passenger aircraft segment is the largest segment, followed by the cargo and business segments. The materials composition for commercial and cargo aircrafts are mostly the same while that of business aircrafts may vary a bit.

Commercial passenger aircraft are purchased as either base efficiency or high efficiency models. To increase profits, companies by default prefer purchasing the high efficiency models. The designs of these aircraft mainly focus on higher fuel efficiency, more load-bearing capacity and lower carbon emissions. Customers/buyers of these aircraft, such as commercial airlines, are expected to follow strict pollution norms which in turn impact the manufacturing process of the aircrafts. The manufacturers of commercial aircraft invest large sums in R&D on better materials to cope with the tightening regulations. The prime focus of these R&D activities is to develop lightweight materials with enough strength and stability so that they can replace existing heavy materials such as metals and alloys. The lighter structure helps to achieve higher fuel efficiency and lower emissions, thereby decreasing the expense of operations and increasing profit margin for operators.

The table presents the global market for aerospace ceramics in commercial aerospace by region from 2020 to 2026. North America is the largest market, with values increasing from $1,356.1 million in 2020 to $1,833.1 million in 2026, showing a CAGR of 5.2%. Europe follows as the second-largest market, growing from $914.7 million to $1,178.9 million with a CAGR of 4.5%. APAC shows the highest growth rate with a CAGR of 6.9%, increasing from $402.9 million to $588.3 million. The Rest of the World (RoW) has the smallest market share but demonstrates strong growth with a CAGR of 6.0%, rising from $197.8 million to $272.6 million. Overall, the global market is projected to grow from $2,871.5 million in 2020 to $3,872.8 million in 2026, with a CAGR of 5.3%.

Composites, especially carbon- and glass-based, have become a strong competitor to conventional materials used in aerospace in structural applications. GLARE and CRFP are widely used in aircraft bodies while SiC composites are gaining popularity in engine components. Composites are also preferred in nose, tail and landing gear parts.

Commercial aircraft production is dominated by Boeing (U.S.) and Airbus (France). These two companies account for more than 90% of global commercial aircraft fleet. These companies have most of their operations located in their home countries. Thus, the aerospace ceramics market for commercial aerospace industry is concentrated in the U.S. and France.

Other key players in the commercial aerospace industry are Embraer (Brazil), Bombardier (Canada), Commercial Aircraft Corporation of China COMAC (China), and Cessna Aircraft (U.S.). As China recovered sooner than U.S. and European countries from COVID-19 shutdowns, COMAC was able to resume its aircraft production by the end of 2020. Thus, the demand for ceramics and composites for aerospace applications gained momentum in Asia before the developed regions.

The global aircraft industry suffered significant losses due to COVID-19 shutdowns and decreased travel demand during 2020. The demand for commercial aircraft took a hit, dropping by ~40% compared to 2019. Boeing's deliveries dropped by 57% and those of Airbus dropped by 34%. Also, Boeing had to ground its 737 Max fleet due to technical issues in the sensor system. The order cancellations for Boeing and Airbus cascaded to the leading component manufacturers in the industry, impacting the demand for aerospace ceramics and composites in 2020. Though the commercial aircraft industry is showing signs of recovery, the backlog is still large enough to impact the new production orders of aircraft.

Another factor that has an impact on the commercial aircraft industry is the revenue of airline companies. In 2020, the revenue per kilometer (RPK) dropped more than 65%, pulling down the profits of airlines over a steep slope. As per the International Air Transport Association (IATA), the key performance indicators of commercial airline industry are estimated to stay low during 2021.

The following table shows key indicators for airline industry with forecast values of 2021.

The table presents key performance indicators for the airline industry from 2019 to 2021, including forecasts for 2021. It shows a significant decline in various metrics from 2019 to 2020, likely due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Net post-tax profit dropped from $26.4 billion in 2019 to a loss of $126.4 billion in 2020, with a forecasted loss of $47.7 billion in 2021. Operating margin fell from 5.2% in 2019 to -28.2% in 2020, with a slight improvement to -9.4% expected in 2021. RPK growth saw a dramatic decline of 65.9% in 2020, but is forecasted to grow by 26% in 2021, although still only reaching 43% of 2019 levels. Passenger numbers decreased from 4.5 billion in 2019 to 1.8 billion in 2020, with a slight recovery to 2.4 billion expected in 2021. Interestingly, cargo yield saw a significant increase of 40% in 2020, likely due to increased demand for air freight during the pandemic, with a further 5% growth expected in 2021. Fuel prices dropped in 2020 but are forecasted to rise again in 2021, while non-fuel unit costs increased sharply in 2020 but are expected to decrease in 2021.

It is estimated that international air travel will grow in 2021 is estimated to only 34% of its pre-COVID level. Such slow growth will negatively impact the production activity for the aerospace industry. The aircraft production industry is not expected to reach pre-COVID levels until the middle of the decade due to existing inventory and low orders. Many industry experts believe that the industry will not recover to a pre-COVID level of orders (2019) until sometime during the period of 2023 to 2025.

The table presents data on the deliveries of top aircraft models in the commercial airline industry from 2015 to 2020. Key observations include:

1. A320 Family consistently had the highest number of deliveries throughout the period, peaking at 1,160 units in 2017.
2. Boeing 737 showed strong performance until 2018, with a significant drop in 2019 (69 units) and a slight recovery in 2020 (130 units).
3. A220 model deliveries began in 2018 with 135 units and remained relatively stable in the following years.
4. A380 had very low delivery numbers, with zero deliveries in 2017, 2019, and 2020.
5. Boeing 747 had consistently low delivery numbers, with no data available for 2019.
6. Most models showed a decrease in deliveries in 2020, likely due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the aviation industry.

Airbus and Boeing are planning to cope with the situation by ramping up the production of their bestselling models in coming years. Airbus will increase the production rate of its A320 family by the end of the year, while Boeing will focus on 737 Max production after the plane's recertification. Also, in 2020 Airbus stopped production of its A380 model as it was not getting the expected response from the airline industry. Boeing is planning to reduce the production rate of its 787 series from 2021 onwards and push back the production of the 777X to 2023. These delayed production schedule of aircraft models which have a high share of composites will impact demand for ceramics in the industry during the forecast period.

The table presents data on leading business jet manufacturers and their unit sales from 2015 to 2020. Key observations include:

1. Bombardier Business Aircraft consistently led in sales volume throughout the period, peaking at 199 units in 2015 and ending with 114 units in 2020.
2. Textron Aviation (Cessna Aircraft) showed steady growth from 2015 to 2019, reaching a peak of 206 units in 2019 before declining to 132 units in 2020.
3. Gulfstream Aerospace Corp. maintained relatively stable sales, with a slight decline from 154 units in 2015 to 127 units in 2020.
4. Cirrus Aircraft experienced significant growth, starting from 0 units in 2015 to 73 units in 2020.
5. Honda Aircraft Co. also showed growth, increasing from 2 units in 2015 to 31 units in 2020.
6. Pilatus entered the market in 2018 with 18 units and grew to 41 units by 2020.
7. The total market size fluctuated over the years, peaking at 809 units in 2019 before dropping to 644 units in 2020.

The business and private jet segment is led by Bombardier and Textron Aviation. Though the number of jets sold under this segment seem comparable to that of the passenger segment, the size of these aircraft is very small when compared to an airline aircraft. Thus, the material consumption during business or private jet production contributes a small share to the ceramic market. Considering the demand side, this is the least affected segment of the aerospace industry. It is estimated the demand for business jets will catch up to 2019 levels by the end of 2021 and continue to grow as it had been prior to the pandemic. North America is the leading consumer of business and private jets, followed by Europe. These regions also contribute the largest share in the business jet production industry. The demand for business jets is estimated to be grow rapidly during 2021–2023 and then normalize during 2023–2025.

Jet engines are another key focus area of applications for ceramics in the aerospace industry. The leading jet engine manufacturers, GE Aviation, Pratt & Whitney, Rolls Royce, and CFM International, have increased their funding for CMC facilities. These companies have managed to increase the performance of jet engines using ceramic or composite components and coatings in their engines. Noticing the benefits, GE and Pratt & Whitney have established separate facilities to increase production and more R&D in the area. Since composites play a vital role in GE's LEAP and GE9X engines, GE started production of SiC composites in Huntsville, Alabama in 2015. Pratt & Whitney established a 60,000 sq. ft. R&D facility in Carlsbad, California in 2019.

Apart from the jet engine manufacturers, the CMC market has other key players such as CoorsTek, 3M, Applied Thin Films, and Ube Industries. The composites industry has seen some interesting developments focused on the aerospace applications. Nakashima Propeller (Japan) managed to develop a composite material that is 40% to 50% lighter than conventional propeller materials, thereby increasing fuel efficiency by 5% to 6%. Toray Industries, another leading CRFP manufacturer from Japan, introduced a high performing CFRP for aircraft engine components. As ceramics and ceramic composites help jet engine manufacturers increase efficiency of their products while reducing emissions, their popularity is growing. With tightening regulations for the airline industry, the demand is therefore expected to grow rapidly along with continuous investments in R&D for better materials.

# Defense Aerospace Industry

The defense aerospace segment is different from other aerospace markets as the customer side is a government authority or organization. As the client has its budget allocated at beginning of a year and deal, the demand remains mostly unaffected by the environmental and micro-economic factors. The long-term contracts tend to dilute the impact of short-term disruptions. However, as COVID-19 affected the players in the value chain of the industry it did manage to slow down production to some extent. At the same time, the increasing tensions between regional powers and constant threat of terrorism are expected to fuel the demand for defense aircrafts in coming years.

Companies such as Lockheed Martin (U.S.), L3Harris (U.S.) and Rolls Royce (U.K.) registered profit even during the pandemic. Lockheed's revenue growth is due to increased demand for F-35 fighter jets. With decreased prices for the aircraft, the company expects the demand to keep rising during the forecast period.

In 2020, global military expenditures increased by 2.9% on a year-on-year basis, registering the highest total over the past three decades. The percentage share of military expenditure of global GDP increased sharply as there was a COVID-induced drop in global GDP but military expenditures remained constant. The leading countries in the global military market are the U.S., Russia, the U.K., China, and India. According to Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI), Africa registered the highest growth in military expenditure followed by Europe and North America during the year. The defense aerospace industry is estimated to follow the military expenditure graph closely, thereby growing in the same pattern. Like the commercial aerospace segment, most of the military aircraft production takes place in North America and Europe. Thus, the growing demand for military aircraft across the globe will subsequently drive the demand for ceramics and composites in North America and Europe during the forecast period.

The following table shows the change in military expenditure over the past two years of the top 10 countries in the world.

Also, the defense segment includes unmanned air vehicles and drones along with fighter jets and rotorcraft. UAVs and drones are a great help when it comes to surveillance and defense in harsh environment conditions and difficult terrain. Since UAVs and drones often operate in extreme environments the materials they are made of should have high corrosion resistance. Composites can be manufactured using combinations of different materials, thereby giving the UAV or drone specific characteristics. For instance, composites can be designed to absorb certain frequency waves and transmit different frequencies. This can help these craft to avoid being detected on radar and thus avoid anti-air defense systems. These benefits make composites the preferred choice for UAV production. However, the small size of drones leads to less consumption of material when compared to fighter jets and rotorcraft So UAVs and drones contribute a smaller share to the aerospace ceramic market.

## Commercial Space Industry

The commercial space industry is expected to be the fastest growing segment during the forecast period. This segment mainly refers to spacecraft and satellites. The rapid growth of the segment is being driven by increasing demand from the small satellites industry. The demand is characterized by applications for imaging and image-based analytics for agriculture, economic forecasting, urban planning, resource management, disaster monitoring, retail, maritime, and other applications. There is also increasing demand for satellite broadcasting in military, telecommunication and entertainment applications. These satellites can be as small as microwaves and cost less than a million dollars. Many countries are investing in infrastructure and technology development to cope with the demand, thereby driving consumption of ceramics and composites in the satellite industry across the globe. The U.S. leads the satellite manufacturing industry; it accounts for more than 60% of the global market.

Figure 22 shows the shares of satellites launched globally by end-use purpose in 2020. The pie chart provides the following information:

1. Commercial Communication dominates the satellite market with an 84.0% share.
2. Remote Sensing accounts for 11.0% of satellites launched.
3. Others, which include Military, Scientific, Navigation, and Satellite Servicing, make up 5.0% of the market.

This distribution highlights the significant emphasis on commercial communication in the satellite industry, with remote sensing being the second most important application. The relatively small share of other purposes suggests that commercial applications are currently driving the majority of satellite launches globally.

The space industry needs vehicles similar to the commercial aerospace segment but with more robust performance and higher characteristic ratings. The operating environment of space vehicles is extreme and much different than that of other aerospace segments. The materials used for spacecraft need to be able to sustain performance and shape in the presence of high radiation, friction from the atmosphere and landing impact. The exposure to radiation can trigger surface erosion in materials, which subsequently can result in structural damage. Also, the thermal protection system of a space craft needs to face the high temperatures while passing through atmosphere and the low temperatures while in space. With increasing speed of aircraft and changing designs, spacecraft materials such as ceramics and composites are making their way into aircraft applications to cope with increased performance needs.

Ceramics and composites are widely popular in the spacecraft industry for thermal and structural applications. Composites, especially carbon-based, have been at the center of most of the material developments in the industry. Carbon-based composites are used in the TPS of spacecraft and satellites. Thus, the increasing production rate of spacecraft and satellites will drive the demand for ceramics and composites in the industry.

As many countries are battling with the variants of corona and mucormycosis, it is expected the aerospace industry will recover slowly in the initial phase of the forecast period. With a decreased number of passengers and stricter safety regulations, the best way for commercial aerospace players to stem losses is to increase profit margins with available traffic. This puts the idea of increasing the fuel efficiency of aircraft in the spotlight. The primary solution to this is to reduce the weight of aerostructures by replacing heavy components (mostly metals) with lighter materials. Though the aerospace industry has already been investing significant money and effort into the development of lightweight materials, the hit from pandemic is expected to put these activities into high gear, thereby increasing the adoption of ceramics and composites in more structural applications in the aerospace industry. These developments will drive the demand for ceramics and composites during the forecast period.

This chapter discusses regional trends in detail.

Boeing is the global leader in commercial aircraft production, and it is also expanding its business in the military and space segments. The company leads the ceramics and composites demand in the U.S. in the commercial aerospace segment. Boeing has been increasing the share of composites in its aircraft models over the years, leveraging their light weight and high-strength characteristics. In 2020, Boeing faced strong headwinds due to the grounding of its 737 Max, weaker demand for the 777X and the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. The company postponed its 777X production plans to 2022,Twhich will decrease the potential growth rate for ceramics in the commercial aerospace segment in the country. Though the 737 Max completed its recertification in 2020, Boeing's deliveries dropped by more than 55%, which resulted in supply chain disruption across the aerospace industry And also drastically decreased demand for ceramics and composites in the commercial aerospace segment in 2020.

The defense aerospace segment consists of aircraft from Boeing, Lockheed Martin, Northrup Grumman, Bell, and other suppliers. Following are some of the key aircraft manufactured by these companies.

Six out of top 10 military aerospace companies of the world are from U.S., thus making the country the global leader in the military aircraft segment. The defense segment was not affected by COVID-19 as severely as the commercial segment. Indeed, the revenue of the top six military aircraft manufacturers in the country increased by 2% with increased foreign sales in 2020. Lockheed Martin, a leading manufacturer of military aircraft, saw a revenue increase of 9% due to increasing demand for its F-35. The company further plans to decrease the cost of F-35 to push the product demand higher in near future. Another key development in the defense segment was that in June 2021, Boeing successfully tested the MQ-21, a refueling UAV with U.S. Air Force. This drone UAV can transport fuel to fighter jets for midair fueling. For the UAV segment, China plays an important role as a leading supplier of composite components (fuselage), electric motors and PCSs to the U.S. The defense aerospace segment in the country will continue to be vibrant during the forecast period with the introduction of new aircraft, further development of UAVs and increasing demand for fighter jets around the globe.

# Chapter 8: Emerging Materials: Background and Applications

Aerospace materials include many categories of advanced materials that offer improved performance, lighter weight, higher strength, improved safety, and in some cases lower cost than conventional technologies. Even though material costs may be higher, many ceramic-based and other newer aerospace materials can more than offset their high initial cost through reduced operational cost, reduced fuel usage, and reduced maintenance and repair cost.

This chapter provides a background discussion on aerospace materials and their applications to offer readers a clear understanding of the types and categories of aerospace materials. Aerospace materials serve as versatile alternatives to conventional materials and this chapter reviews such overlaps in terms of recent historic perspective as well as anticipated future development. This chapter also summarizes key performance metrics for aerospace materials and reviews recent development in the industry.

## Background

Rising demand for improved fuel efficiency, enhanced performance and increased safety is driving the aerospace industry to deploy new, lighter weight, stronger materials that were once considered too costly or too difficult to utilize for day-to-day production activities. Historically, the aerospace materials market transitioned away from aluminum towards carbon fiber-based composites and honeycomb structures, while maintaining use of superalloys and other physically heavy materials for critical parts such as engine/turbine components. Now, manufacturers increasingly rely on carbon fiber reinforced polymers (CFRPs) wherever possible. At the same time the industry has begun to view heavy working components of the airplane with increased scrutiny, looking to develop and deploy physically lighter materials and alloys. The key target for such alloys includes materials that are both lighter and also offer greater temperature resistance, where both properties can contribute to improved fuel efficiency.

Advanced materials are particularly important in current engine designs. Today's learn-burn engines carry temperature potentials of up to about 3800°F. Therefore, these high-efficiency systems also burn extra hot, potentially surpassing the melting point of currently available superalloys which is below 3500°F. Superalloys are still a mainstay in the engine/turbine production industry, but their weight and limited thermal properties leave the engine production industry ripe for transition to a new class of heat-resistant, lighter weight materials. Newer material classes include heat-resistant superalloys and non-metal composites including ceramics.

Finally, the space industry is growing in terms of market size. Over 80 countries now have satellites in space and private companies such as SpaceX and Boeing are increasingly making headlines as commercial players enter the marketplace. Market volumes for space industry specialty materials are still small and will likely remain so for the next five years. As a result, these are not considered in this report. However, overlap for materials in the commercial aircraft industry is significant, as many of the same materials have also been adopted for space-related activities and equipment. We will quantify these markets as one element of the approximately $250 billion space market.

# History

Early aerospace materials focused on using the lightest metals available for airplane and rocket construction. It was the U.S.'s ability to quickly refine and separate large amounts of aluminum that helped the country manufacture airplanes rapidly during World War II. But perhaps the most significant early application for advanced aerospace materials in the industry centered on the construction of new types of engines. Engines subject to extreme heat and mechanical forces required the development of new metals and new alloys capable of withstanding extreme environments.

In the period of 1900 to1910, the reliability of steel was greatly improved by a process called vacuum melting. This process enabled manufacturers to have closer control of elemental compositions, and also prevented the unintended incorporation of airborne nitrogen and oxygen into the still as it formed. These gases could become physically trapped in the metals, reducing their strength. Vacuum melting was also a critical process in enabling the addition and control of various refractory and other specialty elements such as aluminum, tantalum and niobium. It also allowed careful control of the alloy production process and enabled manufacturers to tune the composition of nickel, cobalt, chrome, molybdenum, aluminum, and other elements without nonmetallic impurities.

Superalloys constituted the industry's first major new material-oriented advancement. The term "superalloy" came about in the mid-1940s to describe a group of recently invented alloys that could be used at exceptionally high temperatures, but that also maintain their strength, resistance and toughness at these high temperatures. These alloys were developed primarily in support of aircraft turbine engine development, which requires high performance under conditions of exceptionally high temperatures and high mechanical stress. These alloys maintained their strength almost wholly until they reached their melting points.

The need for temperature-resistant metals or steel was strongly driven by advances during the late industrial revolution and its outgrowth of various products. Initially nickel, chromium and cobalt were added to iron and were considered high-temperatures alloys into the 1940s. Engineers, particularly those were in U.S and Europe, invented an array of high-temperature alloys that were used to meet existing and perceived future industrial needs. However, in order to transition from high-temperature alloys to superalloys a new production technology was necessary.

Prior to the 1940s superalloys and their precursors found application primary in the manufacturing industry. Businessmen such as Elwood Haynes, an early automotive entrepreneur, sought to streamline, economize and speed up the automobile manufacturing process. This drive led to increasingly rapid machining, which ultimately was limited by cutting tools that would wear down rapidly, requiring frequent replacement. Demand surged for alloys that were able to withstand high temperatures while retaining their hardness. The solution came about as a cobalt-chrome alloy, which eventually evolved into vitallium (65% cobalt, 30% chromium, 5% molybdenum, and traces of other substances). Other new and highly resistance alloys being developed at that time included nickel-chromium alloys, cobalt-chromium alloys and iron-chromium-nickel alloys. These alloys targeted a range of applications including cutting tools for machines, alloys used for heating elements, internal combustion engine parts, steam turbine blades, pistons, and use in valves and valve components.

By the 1940s and 1950s new airplane engine technology in the form of turbine engines became the principal driver for the development of superalloys and the superalloy production industry. As demand grew for increasingly durable alloys in the aircraft industry, high temperature and other early superalloy precursor metals gave way to the more common use of nickel- and cobalt-based superalloys. In this manner, gas turbine engine development and non-propeller engines in the aviation industry were founded on the heat resistant backbone of superalloys. Over the ensuing decades, superalloys found other applications, but the aircraft (and later the aerospace) industry remained the primary driver of the R&D and innovation encompassing the advancement of superalloys.

In 1950 and 1951, the re-emergence of vacuum melting for superalloy production led to another round of substantial progress in superalloy development. At this time the significant benefits of vacuum melting were more wholly recognized. These advantages included the minimization of oxidation and potential for oxygen removal from the existing composition of the metal prior to its melting. Vacuum melting and degassing techniques permitted the use of highly active elemental additions such as titanium. At this time titanium- and aluminum-containing alloys for jet engines rapidly transitioned from air melting to vacuum melting production techniques, giving the alloys new and enhanced creep strength and consistency never before realized.

By 1957, Allvac Metals co. opened its doors with the groundbreaking for installation of a 500 lb. vacuum induction melting furnace. With the first official melt in 1957, the company unexpectedly pivoted from military to commercial jet applications, chasing the market trends of the day. By the early 1960s the superalloy market was beginning to take off of and vacuum induction melting became the standard process for producing high-temperature alloys. From that time through the present, the commercial aerospace industry has remained the primary global market for superalloys. Subsequent years brought development and entrenching of industry favorite superalloys (for example alloy 718) along with alloy specifications and an increasing degree of standardization in manufacturing processes. Today superalloys are available in several product forms including.

- Ingots and billet for extrusions and die forgings.
- Slabs for rolling into plates and sheets.
- Billets and bars forged round or rectangular.
- Forged cylindrical or tapered and stepped shafts.
- Bar and coil shaped in round or rectangular forms.
- Hot rolled plate.
- Hot rolled sheet.
- Hot extruded tubing.
- Cold pilger rolling.
- Cold drawn bar, rod, coil, and wire.
- Cold rolled sheet and strip.

Aerospace materials have expanded into several additional key areas. These changes have come about from a continued demand for increased performance, reduced weight and strength with less bulk. Like the global automotive industry, the global aerospace industry is now undergoing a new round of significant material- and design-oriented upgrades focused largely on weight reduction. Reducing the weight of aerospace materials significantly reduces the amount of fuel needed to support operations. Over the last 20 years, this fact has become increasingly important not only to reduce the amount of money spent on fuel purchase, but also to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, which has become critical to many countries. As a result, new advanced composites, ceramic-based composites and advanced alloys were given the opportunity to develop and expand into the market

## Aerospace Materials

### Advanced Steel Alloys

Conventional steels include carbon steel and steel plate. However, advanced steel alloys, particularly those that provide high strength or that are highly resistant to wear or corrosion, find frequent application in the global aerospace industry. Critical advantages of high-performance steel alloys can be difficult to reproduce using other materials. For example, high-strength carburizing steel can offer exceptional hardness, good fracture resistance, high fatigue strength, excellent corrosion resistance, and high temperature resistance all in a single alloy.

The primary drawback of steel is its weight. High-strength steel does, however, help to manage weight to some degree. For example, high-strength steel alloys are stronger than conventional steel and therefore require less mass/material. This reduced mass translates into reduced weight typically on the order of 10% in terms of weight reduction.

***Page 146***

Common applications include structural elements, gears, helicopter and propeller transmissions and drivetrain elements, rotor shafts, fasteners, other highly loaded components, landing gear hook shank components, landing gears, actuators, munitions, gun barrels, blast resistant applications and impact containment.

Advanced steel alloys represent a new and continually refreshed set of materials that have a long history of development and improvement. Today's alloys continue to focus on improved performance, increased corrosion resistance, improved strength, and where possible weight reduction.

## Advanced Aluminum Alloys

In comparison to neat aluminum, advanced aluminum alloy is largely focused on increasing strength. Alloying elements may not necessarily reduce material density, but can substantially increase strength, resilience and other key properties. Therefore, similar to high-strength steel, advanced aluminum alloys reduce the total amount of material needed. This in turn reduces weight overall, even though an advanced alloy might actually have higher density.

Aluminum alloys are commonly used in place of steel for structural elements in the aerospace industry. Today's aluminum alloys are high strength and can be highly resistant alloys that are actively designed to serve as an upgrade from older, less advanced aluminum alloys such as 7050-T74 aluminum alloy. Even 7000 series aluminum alloys, however, are considered exceptionally usable for a wide array of aerospace applications and are generally used as a replacement for lower grade aluminum alloy or where appropriate structural steel.

Common applications for advanced aluminum alloys include aircraft structural frame components, wingspans, internal components, and in some cases gearbox or drivetrain components. Engineers are continuing to push the limits of aluminum alloys as they look for new ways to reduce weight of key components. This process is increasingly pushing into moving components of aerospace equipment including airplanes and helicopters, where possible components are being redesigned and in some cases rethought entirely to accommodate lighter weight aluminum alloy material.

## Titanium and Its Alloys

Titanium alloys provide exceptional lightness and strength. They are also more expensive than many of the more common steel and aluminum alloys. Key advances in titanium alloys are focused on how to incorporate lower-cost raw materials and thereby reduce the cost of the alloys overall. Other key benefits can include improved ductility and improved castability.

Titanium that is commercially pure titanium is also used in aircraft, its primary benefit being that its density is only 60% that of conventional steel while also exhibiting high strength and excellent corrosion resistance. Titanium also exhibits good compatibility with CFPR including corrosiveness and thermal expansion rates. Titanium alloys further improve on these benefits. In fact, the amount of titanium used in fuel efficient aircraft has been growing significantly. In fuel efficient aircraft, for example, the amount of titanium used can be two or three times that of a conventional aircraft. From 2010 through early 2020, available data indicate that the demand for titanium and its alloys for aerostructure materials nearly quadrupled.

***Page 147***

Titanium and its alloys are increasingly being considered for airframe structural components. In frames and joints where high-strength steel was once required titanium alloys are now frequently used to save weight. Titanium is also being incorporated into select elements of turbofan engines. While superalloys of steel are required in the combustion and turbine sections of jet engines, titanium alloys are increasingly used in the cooler compressor sections, which feed the combustion and turbine segments. Newer uses for titanium and its alloys include reinforcement for airframe structure conversions, support for cargo loading platforms and conveyor systems, and installation of oversize doors and hatches.

Titanium alloys in the aerospace industry may include roll formed stringers, extrusions, sit track to sheet, plate, bar and tubing elements. These are common structural elements for airframes as well as steel sections, bulk heads and other plane segments. New titanium alloys that provide increased casting performance and further ductility improvements could result in more widespread adoption of these alloys across an increasing scope of aerospace platforms, where titanium corrosion resistance and strength could potentially combine reduced cost with near net shape processing.

## Superalloys

There are three basic categories of superalloys: nickel, iron and cobalt-based superalloys.

### Nickel Superalloys
Nickel-based superalloys are best suited for power generation and air jet turbine applications, with primary solutes in the nickel matrix being chromium, aluminum and titanium. Nickel superalloys are the most common in terms of production volumes and applications, relying on nickel as a primary base metal.

Nickel superalloys find wide use in load bearing structures, especially within the combustion section of gas turbine engines. They provide the highest homologous temperature of common alloy systems, retaining their strength at up to 90% of their melting point. The combination of a nickel base metal with up to about 10% (or sometimes 20% or more) of aluminum, chromium and titanium generates a two-phase equilibrium microstructure. These consist of gamma and gamma prime microstructures, which are largely responsible for the elevated temperature strength and other keystone properties exhibited by superalloys.

### Iron Superalloys
Iron-based superalloys are generally considered to be of a lower grade than nickel or cobalt-based superalloys. However, iron superalloys are also less costly to produce. Iron-based superalloys are classified by the American Iron and Steel Institute (AISI) as follows:

- AISI 601 through 604: Martensitic low-alloy steels.
- AISI 610 through 613: Martensitic secondary hardening steels.
- AISI 614 through 619: Martensitic chromium steels.
- AISI 630 through 635: Semi-austenitic and martensitic precipitation-hardening stainless steels.
- AISI 650 through 653: Austenitic steels strengthened by hot/cold work.
- AISI 660 through 665: Austenitic superalloys: all grades except alloy 661 are strengthened by second-phase precipitation.

Like other superalloys, iron-based superalloys are generally characterized by strength and resistance to creep, corrosion resistance, oxidation resistance, and wear resistance at high temperature. Iron-based superalloys also exhibit these properties under room-temperature conditions. Wear resistance is a particular strength of iron-based superalloys, particularly when increasing levels of carbon are incorporated, which acts to enhance this property. Resistance to oxidation can also be enhanced with increasing chromium content.

Iron-based superalloys are available in all conventional mill forms, including billet, bar, sheet, and various forgings. Special shapes are also readily available for most iron-based superalloys. In general, austenitic (containing chromium and nickel, as well as sometimes molybdenum and nitrogen) alloys are more difficult to machine than martensitic (typically at least 12% chromium, and up to about 1.2% carbon content) types, which machine best in the annealed condition. Austenitic alloys are usually best when machined after being partially aged or fully hardened.

## Cobalt Superalloys

Cobalt-based superalloys derive from a series of stellite alloys that were originally patented in the early 1900s by Elwood Haynes. Today, cast and wrought cobalt-based superalloys continue to be used because they can be engineered to have higher melting points than nickel or iron-based superalloys. This property can enable them to absorb stress under a higher absolute temperature.

Due to high chromium content in many cobalt-based superalloys, they can support increased corrosion resistance, even in high-performance gas turbines.

Many cobalt alloys provide enhanced resistance to thermal fatigue as well as and enhanced weldability in comparison to nickel-based superalloys.

Like nickel-based superalloys, cobalt-based superalloys also carry a face-centered cubic structure, when stabilized (such as at room temperature). Precipitation of carbides can harden cobalt superalloys, and they therefore typically contain carbon as an additive. Chromium is frequently added to enhance corrosion resistance, while various other metals may be added to enhance other specific properties. Other metals such as tungsten, molybdenum, tantalum, niobium, zirconium, and hafnium can be added to provide solid solution strengthening.

In comparison to nickel-based superalloys, the stress rupture curve for cobalt alloys is flatter and shows lower strength to about 930°C. The greater stability of carbides, which provide strengthening of cobalt alloys, then asserts itself. This factor is the primary reason cobalt alloys are used in the lower-stress, higher-temperature stationary vanes for gas turbines.

# Composite Materials: CFRPs

Carbon fiber-reinforced polymers (CFRPS) offer many significant benefits for the aerospace industry. CFRPs are both strong and lightweight. They can be used for the manufacture of various aerospace materials and equipment, and they are already being used in many of the products used in people's daily lives, from bicycles to automobiles.

Within the CFRP matrix, it is the carbon fibers themselves that provide strength to CFRP systems. Carbon fiber mesh or fabric is then set within a thermosetting resin, which may be an epoxy, vinyl ester or polyester polymer.

In addition to standard CFRPs, this category also includes carbon fiber-reinforced thermoplastic composites. These materials are structurally similar to standard CFRPs, except that they provide increased heat resistance, thanks to a reliance on a thermoplastic base for the thermosetting resin. As a result, these materials can withstand higher operating temperatures than standard CFRPs, including those that rely on thermoplastics, and offer the following beneficial properties:

## High Strength-to-Weight Ratio
Carbon fiber composites are typically much stronger than conventional metals and alloys, on a weight basis. For example, CFRP is typically about five times stronger than an equivalent mass of structural steel. As a result, significantly less mass is required to provide the same structural support as a conventional steel frame. Another example is that CFRP is approximately 1.5 times stronger than aluminum on a mass basis.

## Lightweight
Lightweighting is a key consideration for the aerospace industry, and CFRP typically holds a density of only about 0.055 lbs. per cubic inch. In contrast, conventional fiberglass reinforced plastic carries a density of about 0.065 lbs. per cubic inch, while aluminum ranks at 0.098 and steel ranks at 0.29.

CFRPs also suffer from drawbacks. First, they are very high cost. In comparison to conventional fiberglass, CFRP costs at least five times as much, on a weight basis, and up to 20 times as much. In comparison to steel and aluminum, costs can be 20 times as much, 30 times as much or even higher. Cost is a significant consideration for when and how to use CFRPs in the global aerospace industry.

CFRPs also conduct electricity, like a metal, but do not conduct heat as well as metals. Conducting heat is perhaps more of a consideration for the aerospace industry, a fact that limits the use of CFRP or requires re-engineering of mechanical parts for many potential mechanical applications.

# Advanced Composites

Typically we think of composite materials as including a combination of glass or carbon fiber substrate with a polymer-based matrix material, as is used in CFRP or fiberglass. However, the strict definition of a composite material is simply that it contains at least two parts: a reinforcement element, which works by providing structural and mechanical strength, and the matrix material, where the matrix material simply holds the structural elements together and in place. There are many types of materials that can be used as composites.

One such category of advanced composites is ceramic matrix composites (CMCs), which are a specific category of composites that rely on ceramics for both structural and matrix elements. Other secondary fibers can also be incorporated into the matrix, to provide additional improvements and desired properties. Reinforcing fibers can range in diameter from roughly that of a hair down to exceptionally small nanofibers. These are typically woven into a fabric or fiber system. Key advantages of CMCs include:

- High mechanical strength even at exceptionally high temperatures.
- Stiffness
- Mechanical stability.
- Thermal stability.
- Dimensional stability.
- Chemical resistance.
- Corrosion resistance.
- Fracture resistance.
- Ultra-lightweight.
- High durability.

CMCs do not, however, exhibit high compressive strength, and delamination can be a concern in some cases.

The primary driver behind the development of advanced composites is the need to maintain operability even under extremely high temperatures, up to 1800° C or higher. Applications for these advanced composites include high stress/high-temperature operations. These can include turbine blades, stator vanes, bulletproof armor heating elements, heat exchangers, burner parts, refractory elements, jet engine thrust control flaps, insolation, heat shields, burner stabilizers, rocker propulsion equipment, thermo photovoltaic burners, jet engine/turbo components, and combustion liners/refractory elements for gas turbine engines.

# Advanced Adhesives

Advanced adhesives for aerospace applications include several categories of aerospace tapes and adhesives. Common tape products Include polyurethane protective tape and structural adhesive film. Other advanced adhesives used in the aerospace industry include urethane adhesive, epoxy adhesives, specific bonding adhesives for, for example, brackets, structural adhesives, and structural adhesive films.

Historically, aerospace adhesives have been used as a means to bond insulation, internal panels and flight control surfaces. These uses continue today, for example in bonding face skins to honeycomb core in sandwich constructions. However, across the industry, we are continuing to see growing applications and opportunities for the use of advanced adhesives in composite primary and secondary structural elements and associated assemblies

Adhesive properties can be tailored to specific uses. The results can include substantial changes in their overall properties and function. For example, advanced adhesive formulation can target changes in viscosity, cure time, toughness, heat resistance, chemical resistance, and other properties.

A small percentage of advanced adhesives can be considered structural for use in the aerospace industry. To meet industry standards, such a material must be able to maintain its strength under a shear force of 1.000 psi, when tested according to standard industry practices. These adhesives are commonly available as a paste or as an adhesive film or sheet. Pastes can be used to fill bridge gaps, and can also be deployed to bond parts together In contrast, adhesive films are used in large areas to provide structural bonding, and usually focus more extensively on bonding composites rather than metals. Some adhesives work by forming covalent bonds between surfaces which further enhances their bond strength, and ultimately results in a more effective bonding environment.

## Applications

The following applications for aerospace materials are considered in this chapter: commercial passenger and commercial transport aircraft, general aviation, helicopters, defense industry and government, and the commercial space industry.

### Commercial Passenger Aircraft and Commercial Transport Aircraft

These two categories are treated separately in the market sections but are combined here because the types of advanced aerospace materials used in both categories are similar, and the planes themselves are also similar in outer body construction and engine/propulsion systems. There are two main facets to commercial aircraft: commercial passenger aircraft and commercial transport aircraft. The most successful commercial passenger aircraft globally include the Boeing 737 class, followed by the Airbus A320 aircraft. During 2019 and early 2020, approximately 50 to 60 of each of these aircraft were being manufactured every month. These are medium- to short-haul jets that can hold approximately 120 to 240 passengers. Demand for the jets has grown in recent years thanks to airlines increasing focus on more direct flights, and fewer centralized transfers. This trend has resulted in demand for small- to mid-sized planes that are capable of meeting regional demand at mid-sized airports, while avoiding excess capacity.

© 2021 | BCC Research LLC                   AVM218A Aerospace Ceramics: Global Markets to 2026 | 143
***Page 152***

Boeing and Airbus are not the only players in the commercial aircraft space. Other key players include:

- Bombardier Aircraft.
- Embraer Aircraft.
- Fokker.
- McDonnel Douglas.
- Mitsubishi.
- Sukhoi.
- Irkut.
- COMAC.

In addition to various brands, there are also several types of commercial aircraft, with respect to function and propulsion. Jet aircraft are by far the most common in terms of total market share, in part because mid-sized and large airplanes where most of the market lies are exclusively jet-based engines. However, turboprop engines are more common for smaller aircraft, particularly those used for short distance travel, for either passenger loads or for shipping.

Other categories of commercial aircraft include freighter, combination and convertible aircraft. Key manufacturers include Boeing and Airbus, as well as McDonnell Douglas and Bombardier.

## General Aviation

The general aviation category includes mostly smaller planes that are generally not used for commercial transport or large-scale movement of passengers. General aviation, as defined in this study, includes the following airplane categories:

- Very light jets.
- Light business jets.
- Mid-size business jets.
- Heavy business jets.
- Private single engine.
- Twin turboprops.

The general aviation category supports various charter-run businesses, as well as private aircraft that are used for business. The category also includes very small recreational craft and transport craft, as well as local commercial and public use aircraft. These include small-scale government patrols, local rapid transport and small-scale general service operations.

***Page 153***

# Helicopters

The commercial helicopter market is strongly decoupled from commercial passenger and cargo aircraft markets and is driven by wholly different global market trends and influencing factors. A large segment of the global helicopter market is supported by the oil industry, particularly by the offshore oil and gas industry. Helicopter is the transport method of choice for moving staff and small- to mid-sized items, supplies and equipment to and from oil and gas rigs that are located offshore.

Helicopters are also used for other purposes and end uses, including:

- General transport of people and cargo.
- Medical transport.
- Construction.
- Search and rescue.
- Tourism.
- Agriculture, including crop application.
- Law enforcement.
- Aerial observation.
- Recreation.
- Scientific purposes.

# Defense Industry and Government

Defense industry includes cargo and transport applications, for which the same or very similar technologies can be used as compared to commercial aviation, general aviation or helicopters. Military equipment is typically more specialized, and often manufactured separately from other commercial end products. Military and defense specific applications can include military jets, military turboprops, military helicopters, and military amphibious planes and helicopters. Military jets are typically supersonic fighter jets that are used primarily to bomb strategic targets on the ground or otherwise engage with military targets. These jets cost billions of dollars to develop (development costs are not included in this study), and they are typically deployed from air force bases and navy carriers.

Defense industry and government also includes defense-specific applications. These include missiles rockets and other similar equipment and applications. These advanced design systems are specialty systems designed explicitly for the global defense industry.

***Page 154***

# Commercial Space Industry

The commercial space industry currently focuses primarily on satellite placement and launch. In fact, today's commercial space industry derives the vast majority of its revenues from launching satellites into space. Presently, it is primarily commercial launch providers that are responsible for putting government and commercial/private satellites into orbit. The commercial space industry is allowed only to launch from specific sites globally, with multiple sites in the U.S., as well as launch sites in China and Russia.

Well-publicized space industry activity associated with the International Space Station and other manned and research missions are the subject of much public outreach and interest. However, these activities actually represent only a small fraction of the overall activities in this segment. Increasingly, there has been interest from global superpowers, the U.S., China and Russia in particular, to start moving a greater portion of their defense logistics toward space. These efforts are presently still negligible in terms of revenue generation, but can be expected to increase more substantially, particularly five to 10 years from now.

# Materials Not Considered in this Chapter

There are several materials of interest including those that could someday capture significant market share that have not yet developed to the point of achieving significant market share. The other materials listed here are similar to the aerospace materials, however they are not considered emerging technologies in the industry.

- Conventional steel plate, carbon steel and other conventional metals that are used in some cases for basic structural elements.
- Carpeting, vinyl, foams, and other non-structural cabin elements that use conventional materials.
- Pure aluminum (only aluminum alloys are considered in this study).

The financial overview of Oerlikon Metco for 2020 is presented in two charts:

1. 2020 Revenue, by Business Segment:
   The pie chart shows the revenue distribution between two business segments. Surface Solutions generated 1197 million CHF, while Manmade Fibers contributed 1061 million CHF to the total revenue.

2. Aviation Segment:
   The bar graph illustrates the performance of the Aviation Segment over three years:
   - In 2018, the segment revenue was 204 million CHF.
   - 2019 saw an increase to 245 million CHF, marking the highest point in the three-year period.
   - However, in 2020, there was a significant decline to 167 million CHF, possibly due to the global impact on the aviation industry.

This financial overview reveals that while Oerlikon Metco has a balanced revenue stream from its two main business segments, the Aviation Segment has experienced volatility, with a notable downturn in 2020 after a peak in 2019.
