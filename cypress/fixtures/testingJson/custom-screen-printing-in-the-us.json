As people have more discretionary income, they are more able to spend on non-essential items, such as custom-made clothing.

Screen printers are predicted to intensify their strategic acquisitions and mergers to expand their market share. Revenue increases for custom screen printing businesses will likely decline because of a reduction in print advertising expenditure as marketing trends shift towards digital platforms. Industry employment is expected to decline, contributing to nominal growth in new companies and a more significant share of online industry services, reducing the need for employees to conduct in-person sales."
