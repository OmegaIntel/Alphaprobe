As local and state government investment has fallen recently, contractors have had fewer opportunities, pressuring profit. COVID-19 had a hand in putting construction behind schedule, as the global emergency forced the government to redirect funds away from bridge and elevated highway construction, especially considering that stay-at-home orders severely limited travel. Overall, revenue has been falling at a CAGR of 0.3% over the past five years to total an estimated $15.7 in 2024, despite an increase of 2.6% in 2024 alone.",

This is putting an obvious strain on the government, meaning that investment in bridges and elevated highways has been necessary purely for safety, which has boded well for contractors late.
