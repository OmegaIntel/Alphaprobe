    "executive_summary": "Plant and flower growers have contended with volatile agricultural prices, weakening demand from florists and an influx of low-cost imports through the end of 2023. However, COVID-19 led to a plant and flower growth surge due to a demand for home improvement materials and landscaping services. Also, plant and flower growers occupy a position of strong bargaining power in the supply chain, selling primary products predominantly to wholesales but, more importantly, not to processors. Amid the pandemic, agricultural operators who sold primarily to processors endured stiff price drops due to bottlenecks in processing capacity, causing raw inputs to flood the farm gate. This was different for growers in this industry. In turn, plant and flower grower revenue has increased by a CAGR of 3.2% to reach $19.3 billion over the five years to 2024, including a 1.2% drop in 2024 alone.",

As people faced lockdowns across the globe, social distancing measures and work-from-home mandates, consumer behavior shifted, substantially influencing market trends. Although demand from florists dropped mainly as states shut down nonessential businesses, like retail and restaurants, demand from consumers increased significantly. With more time spent at home, consumers purchased plants and flowers to beautify their living spaces. Additionally, the pandemic led to a surge in gardening as a hobby, further driving demand for plants and flowers from nurseries and garden centers. Revenue is expected to increase 5.8% in 2020 alone."

International trade conditions will likely be similar, though imports will inch downward, easing domestic competition by a degree, while industry exports will only marginally accelerate. Demand from florists will continue weakening. Thus, revenue for plant and flower growers will increase by a CAGR of 0.6% to $19.9 billion through the end of 2029, with profit remaining relatively steady at 5.3%."

Demand for imports is also influenced by natural disasters. Adverse weather conditions harm the quality and volume of plants and flowers and, in turn, reliance on imports grows. South American countries, particularly Colombia and Ecuador, are major sources of imports for cut flowers. These countries have favorable weather conditions and inexpensive labor that facilitate the sale of flowers at a much lower price than domestic flower growers. Due to a pullback in international trade in 2020 during COVID-19, domestic price conditions tightened slightly, which helped plant and flower growers with contracts with these distributors."
