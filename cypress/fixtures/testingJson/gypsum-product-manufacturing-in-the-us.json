Manufacturers in this industry produce gypsum building materials such as wallboards, plasters, moldings, statuaries and architectural plasterwork. As a result, demand for these products is linked to activity in construction markets. Companies have introduced products that improve indoor air quality, which have grown as a revenue share and typically sell at higher prices. Industry profit has benefited most from the vertical integration of the industry's leading companies, which reduces supplier input costs and distribution expenses to downstream markets. Profit is expected to shrink to 5.1% of revenue in 2024, down from 6.2% in 2019.",
