    "executive_summary": "The Musical Instrument and Supplies Stores industry has fallen out of tune as strong external competition has drowned out the sound made by independent stores. As large-scale retailers and online stores made their way into the musical equipment industry, accelerated by COVID-19, traditional brick-and-mortar retailers experienced revenue steadily fall over the past five years. Music stores that have expanded into the online space have experienced more success than those operating strictly in physical locations, but they still have struggled to compete with the prices of larger retailers. Industry revenue is expected to fall at a CAGR of 1.0% to $6.0 billion in 2024, despite a dip of just 1.0% in 2024 alone.",

            "current_performance_point_description": "Mass merchandisers have increasingly added musical instruments and accessories to their product offerings and can negotiate lower prices with manufacturers due to their large size. Music stores have been forced to offer products that differentiate themselves from large retailers, such as unique instrument accessories, high-quality products and hard-to-find instruments that would not be available at less specialized stores. Furthermore, music stores are also able to offer key services such as instrument tuning and music classes that are not available at big-box retailers. However, profit has remained more stable as music stores have moved into these higher value roles for musicians."

On one hand, e-commerce has allowed businesses to reach a wider audience than traditional brick-and-mortar stores, boosting sales, and facilitating international expansion. Conversely, it has also increased competition, as products from around the world are now readily available. Many traditional stores have grappled with adapting to digital platforms and competing with established online marketplaces."

However, competition has increased from discount retailers, such as Walmart and Best Buy which have more substantial negotiating power than this industry's typically tiny, single-owner operators. Local stores also cannot purchase sheet music or other mass-manufactured music items in the same volume as larger chain retailers. To enhance competition, music stores have shifted to a focus on quality, offering excellent customer service, instrument trials and even music community events."

Since hobbyists account for a large share of demand, these alternative leisure activities have effectively reduced the number of consumers that decide to pursue musical instruments, leading to lower demand for musical goods across the board. Fortunately for music stores, online tablature, digital tuning devices, mobile tuning apps and free online lessons and tutorials have made instruments less tricky for beginners to learn."
