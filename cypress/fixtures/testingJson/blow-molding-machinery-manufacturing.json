Private investment in industrial equipment and machinery and downstream demand are key drivers of industry performance, both of which have performed well over the five years to 2021 due to improving economic conditions. Industry growth has stemmed from a rise in investment in industrial equipment and machinery, as downstream users are expanding capacity. However, volatile steel prices led to operators slashing top-line selling prices toward the end of the period. At the same time, due to spread of COVID-19 (coronavirus) demand from downstream markets declined which negatively affected industry revenue.",

Headwinds for industry operators include competition from foreign manufacturers, a volatile US dollar and consumer trends away from plastic products. Nevertheless, continued growth in private investment in machinery, technological advances and solid demand from downstream markets will drive industry revenue to increase at an annualized rate of 3.5% to $375.8 million over the five years to 2026."
