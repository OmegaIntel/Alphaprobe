Companies capitalized on their increased profitability by investing in new office spaces, leading to a surge in nonresidential construction during 2018 and 2019. As organizations built more offices, the demand for generators rose accordingly. The pandemic has influenced volatile residential and nonresidential construction activity, limiting industry expansion. As a result, revenue for prime mover generator set manufacturers is expected to remain stable at $4.3 billion in 2024.",

Companies capitalized on their increased profitability by investing in new office spaces, leading to a surge in nonresidential construction during 2018 and 2019. As organizations built more offices, the demand for generators rose accordingly. Falling commercial construction activity leads to lower spending on prime mover generator sets, offsetting growth in residential activity."

Low downstream demand reduced the need for manufactured products, so the industrial production index (IPI) plunged. There's a renewed focus on innovation to buffer against similar disruptions in the future. Technological advancements are also playing a crucial role, with smarter, more integrated systems becoming more prevalent in factory settings."

Soaring consumer spending raised industrial activity, so manufacturers started to demand prime mover generator sets for their factories and machinery, aiding revenue growth. Households also used their money to buy and build new homes at record levels, boosting downstream demand from the residential sector."

The higher cost of borrowing has made it much harder to purchase homes, office spaces or other structures, so both nonresidential and residential construction has plunged in recent years. Since fewer residential and nonresidential structures have been built, demand for generators has declined recently, offsetting growth earlier in the period."

As families adapt their consumption and saving patterns, they will likely buy homes at higher costs, sparking demand in the residential sector. High interest rates will persist even after inflation declines. This will initially curtail spending but will lead to long-term adjustments in household purchasing behaviors. These families will reach this point during the period, so the housing market will recover, boosting downstream demand for prime mover generator sets from the residential sector and helping the industry grow."
