Higher demand and a slight influx of disposable income enabled consumers to accelerate discretionary spending on entertainment and leisure activities, which lockdown measures prevented in 2020. Racing tracks faced a significant crash in revenue as a result of the outbreak of COVID-19 and subsequent social distancing regulations. As quarantine measures ended, attendance at tracks spiked, resulting in a surge in revenue.",
