            "question": "Does your company face significant competition from substitute goods or services?",
            "answer": "To practice law, an individual must be licensed, so there are no substantial substitute services. However, online services for drafting certain standardized documents, such as wills and employment agreements, have siphoned a modest portion of demand from industry operators."
        },
        {
            "question": "Does your company rely heavily on demand from a single, key market?",
            "answer": "Majority of industry revenue is generated from businesses and corporate clients; as a result, many firms are heavily reliant on these downstream markets. So declining corporate profit significantly impacts operators as it leads to businesses pushing off legal matters or relying on in-house lawyers."
        },
        {
            "question": "Has your company pursued merger and acquisition strategies to gain market share and improve efficiencies?",
            "answer": "Merger and acquisition (M&A) activity increases as bigger firms acquire smaller firms to gain geographic presence, a larger workforce and more clients. In particular, cross-border M&A activity increases industry globalization and international partnerships between businesses and law firms."
        },
        {
            "question": "To what degree are your operations capital intensive?",
            "answer": "The industry is extremely labor-intensive, and as a result, for the typical operator, wages are the largest expense. Expenditure on capital remains minimal and is primarily related to computers and peripheral equipment and software."
        },
        {
            "question": "How does your company safeguard its propriety information/processes?",
            "answer": "Many companies encrypt important files and hire cybersecurity and information technology professionals for the purpose of preventing and minimizing digital security risks."
        },
        {
            "question": "Have you been able to minimize/reduce wage costs through automation?",
            "answer": "Due to the highly labor-intensive nature of the industry, operators cannot replace labor through automation. Operational improvements driven by technological change, such as digital file storage and database management, tend to enhance productivity and organization of law firms, although the legal industry is slow in adapting to evolving technologies."
        },
        {
            "question": "How does your company comply with regulatory requirements?",
            "answer": "Companies work with several associations, such as the American Bar Association and the National Lawyers Association, to stay up to date on industry trends and regulatory changes. Recent trends in regulatory change that affect the industry primarily relate to increasing globalization and technological change."

        {
            "question": "Does your company benefit (either directly or indirectly) from any government legislation?",
            "answer": "Firms indirectly benefit from government regulation because downstream markets that are affected by new regulation turn to law firms to make sure they are in compliance."
        },
        {
            "question": "How does your firm manage its financial risks and uncertainties?",
            "answer": "Given the unpredictable nature of the legal industry, understanding how a law firm manages financial risks provides a window into the firm's financial stability and resilience."

        {
            "question": "What communication skills do you look for in a candidate? How can you improve your staff's communication skills?",
            "answer": "Strong communication skills are essential for contract negotiations and settlements outside of court. Such skills are also necessary to make a strong case in court and interact with clients. Increasing cross-border merger activity in the industry is expected to make knowledge of foreign languages among their attorneys increasingly valuable to law firms."
        },
        {
            "question": "Do you have a strong reputation with clients? How can you build up such a reputation?",
            "answer": "An excellent reputation allows top-tier firms to command extremely high fees. Likewise, strong word-of-mouth recommendations provide business to lawyers in private practices. Law firms engage in pro bono work, invest in their brand and promote ethical work standards to build their reputation."

        {
            "question": "Training process for new hires",
            "answer": "Work in this industry is highly specialized. Lawyers experienced in their field are more likely to be familiar with previous court rulings and the intricacies involved in their area of practice. Lawyers tend to specialize in particular practices, such as securities law or criminal defense, which raises the educational attainment requirements for certain areas of legal practice."

        {
            "question": "Corporate profit",

        },
        {
            "question": "Initial public offerings",
            "answer": "Many major law firms receive significant fees from work on initial public offerings (IPOs), mergers and acquisitions and capital-raising activity."
