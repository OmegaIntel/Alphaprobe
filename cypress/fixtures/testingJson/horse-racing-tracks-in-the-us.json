    "executive_summary": "Horse racing tracks have grappled with declining consumer interest and competition from more accessible forms of gambling like lotteries, casinos and online platforms. While marquee events like the Triple Crown still captivate audiences, many racetracks struggle to attract a younger, more diverse clientele. Aging, predominantly male patrons continue to be the sport's core demographic. As this demographic shrinks and public concerns about horse doping and animal welfare continue, interest in horse racing has waned. Revenue has fallen at a CAGR of 2.8% to $6.4 billion through the end of 2024, including a contraction of 0.5% in 2024 alone.",

The 2018 Supreme Court decision overturning PAPSA legalized sports betting, introducing greater competition. Sports betting is extremely popular and comes at a lower cost, challenging horse racing's ability to retain and attract fans. Although events like the Triple Crown attract viewership, many tracks rely on aging, predominately male customers, struggling to attract patrons outside of that demographic."

In 2024, racinos are only legal in 13 states. While most racinos only have slot machines, many have added other games, like poker, roulette and blackjack.
