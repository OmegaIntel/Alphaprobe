    "executive_summary": "Volatile shifts in consumer demand and market conditions have hurt the Essential Oil Manufacturing industry's expansion through the end of 2023. Essential oils have seen a revival in their popularity amid a growing consumer shift to natural, eco-friendly alternatives of everyday products, aiding industry revenue. However, falling disposable income in the year marked by rising inflationary pressures, along with decreasing demand from cosmetic and beauty products manufacturers, have dampened industry demand. Similarly, the rising costs that come with manufacturers, which include having a consistent line of workers and many machineries to process these plant extracts, have continually pressured profit. Revenue is set to decrease at a CAGR of 2.1% through the end of 2023 to $1.3 billion, including a projected 2.6% increase in 2023 alone.",

Essential oils are luxury items, meaning that as consumers have more income to spend, they can affordably buy these products at a higher amount.
