Since service provision is labor intensive requiring skilled employees, average profit margins are thin. Numerous regulations act as a small barrier, but changes in technology during COVID-19 have brought some changes, evidenced by growth in establishments. New ways to provide services and reach clients offer opportunities to expand geographically. Industry revenue depends on government funding and private donations which can change due to economic conditions and funding policy. Economic, demographic and social stressors also influence service need, impacting revenue volatility.",
