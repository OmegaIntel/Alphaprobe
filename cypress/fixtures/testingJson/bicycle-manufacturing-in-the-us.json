    "executive_summary": "Bicycle manufacturers make new bikes and parts for upgrades and repairs. Demand primarily stems from disposable income and consumer spending. While economic conditions soured during the pandemic, stay-at-home orders and lockdown restrictions supported biking activity, leading to robust growth in 2021. Exercise trends created significant opportunities for bicycle manufacturers during the period. Even so, demand has faltered as employees returned to work; many consumers have prioritized other leisure and entertainment options, stifling demand for new bikes and parts. Overall, revenue climbed at an expected CAGR of 0.8% to $1.1 billion through the current period, despite a 1.1% drop in 2024, where profit settled at 3.6%.",
