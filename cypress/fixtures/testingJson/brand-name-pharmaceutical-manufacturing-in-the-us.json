Eli Lilly's $1.6 billion investment in its Indiana-based manufacturing facility in 2022 and Novartis' new manufacturing facilities in the state will cement this growth moving forward. Indiana houses the global headquarters for Eli Lilly and companies operating in complementary industries, such as manufacturing contract organizations, medical technology and device manufacturers, health insurers and lab diagnostic providers. Access to complementary industries provides pharmaceutical manufacturers numerous advantages, including supply chain efficiency, collaborative innovation, resource sharing and access to talent.",
