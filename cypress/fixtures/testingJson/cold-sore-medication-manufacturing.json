    "executive_summary": "Figures have been adjusted for inflation and are presented in 2021 currency.\n\nRevenue for the Cold Sore Medication Manufacturing industry is expected to fall at an annualized rate of 4.3% to $273.2 million over the five years to 2021, including 5.0% growth in 2021 alone, partly due to lower demand caused by the COVID-19 (coronavirus) pandemic. Generally, demand for cold sore medication is driven by broader trends, such as changes in disposable income, demographic shifts and total healthcare expenditure. Changes in private health insurance coverage can also cause demand to rise or fall, as a share of industry products include pharmaceutical treatments to treat conditions that arise from herpes simplex virus or herpes zoster virus. Common conditions treated by industry products include shingles, chickenpox and cold sores. Most industry products are now sold as over-the-counter (OTC) medications. As a result, downstream demand for products manufactured by this industry stems primarily from the Pharmacies and Drug Stores industry (IBISWorld report 44611).\n\nOverall, consumer demand for industry products has remained steady during the current period due to an increasingly aging population. Cold sore outbreaks often occur when a person's immune system is compromised, and often arise during cold and flu season. The elderly population is especially susceptible to cold sores and other conditions, such as shingles, that require treatment using industry products.\n\nIndustry revenue is expected to rise steadily, increasing at an annualized rate of 2.4% to $308.2 million over the five years to 2026. Still, manufacturers are expected to contend with rising competition over the coming years from generic offerings and OTC products, which carry lower profit. Generics are often sold at a discounted rate as compared with brand name offerings and have been increasingly prescribed to reduce rising healthcare costs in the",

As the COVID-19 (coronavirus) pandemic causes unprecedented levels of unemployment, many people have lost health coverage, which has lowered demand for prescription-only products. Additionally, the high level of economic distress and uncertainty has hurt OTC product demand as consumers may forgo medication if possible. In 2021, industry revenue is expected to rebound as the broader macroeconomic environment recovers."

These operators manufacture medicines that treat a relatively common condition; accordingly, they experience relatively consistent demand regardless of broader economic trends. Overall, increased competition from store-brand options drove the increase in the number of enterprises during the period. Store-brand alternatives to brand-name products have become increasingly popular among consumers, driving the number of industry employees to grow as well. However, as industry operators temporarily furloughed employees during the pandemic to protect their balance sheets, industry employment is expected to fall at an annualized rate of 0.1% to 1,582 workers over the five years to 2021."

Older adults experience a higher incidence of illnesses that affect their immune system, and as a result, they are more prone to cold sores. Therefore, as the population ages, demand for cold sore medication expands, ultimately benefiting the industry. According to the US Census Bureau and IBISWorld estimates, the median age of the population is expected to grow an annualized 0.4% over the five years to 2026. Additionally, the baby boomer generation is getting older, and since this demographic is larger than younger generations, it is an attractive segment for industry operators. As baby boomers age, they will likely make more purchases of industry products."
