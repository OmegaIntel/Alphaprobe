    "executive_summary": "The Music Streaming Services industry has become one of the fastest growing domestic industries over the past decade. Music streaming holds its roots in the introduction of the MP3 file, which was released in the late 1990s. While these websites have come and gone, consumer demand for digital music access has persisted. This demand spurred innovation in the early 2000s and 2010s, leading to the creation of major competing enterprises that characterize the industry today. These brands have benefited from first-to-market access, enabling them to build a significant user base in a short period of time. Still, competition has intensified in recent years, driven by substantial revenue growth since the industry's conception.",
