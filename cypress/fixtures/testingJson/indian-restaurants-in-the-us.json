    "executive_summary": "Indian-Americans represent the second-largest Asian-American community in the United States, with 4.4 million people. Despite making up nearly 1.5% of the US population, the number of Indian restaurants is still relatively modest. The surprisingly low penetration of Indian restaurants in the country reflects the characteristics of Indian immigrants in the United States. Most Indian immigrants are highly skilled and work in professional jobs, creating a shortage of nonprofessional jobs like chefs. Nonetheless, the increasing popularity of Indian culture and rising income levels, especially among this ethnic group, have boosted demand for Indian restaurants. Overall, industry revenue is expected to climb at a CAGR of 2.1% to $4.9 billion over the past five years, including a 1.4% growth in 2024 alone.",

            "current_performance_point_description": "Like other restaurants, profit for Indian restaurants is relatively slim due to high purchase costs and intense price competition. Therefore, profit is expected to make up 4.7% of revenue in 2024. Indian restaurants must source spices from foreign suppliers, thus exposing them to price volatility and logistics disruptions amid the pandemic. Over the next five years, Indian cuisine will continue capturing more interest from foodies, including those from other ethnicities. Curries, biriyanis and naans have been featured in multiple must-eat lists, further contributing to the growing popularity of Indian cuisine. So industry revenue is expected to grow at a CAGR of 1.7% to $5.3 billion over the five years to 2029."

            "current_performance_point_description": "Immigration used to be largely limited to European countries, but an immigration policy change in the 1960s welcomed a wave of Indian immigrants to the United States. Many Indian immigrants come to the US via employment-based visas in tech industries, so they tend to be English-proficient and degree-holders, enabling them to work in professional jobs. With higher education levels, only 5.0% of Indian immigrants work in the service sector, which is much lower compared to that of native Americans and all other immigrants. By contrast, 80.0% of Indian immigrants participate in the management, business, science, and arts occupations, according to the Migration Policy Institute. The continued surge in Indian immigrants to the United States and their growing income have prompted more Indian restaurants to enter the industry. Nonetheless, the number of Indian restaurants in America still falls"

This has marked a significant move of Indian cuisine in the US fine-dining gastronomy map as the Michelin Guide is one of the world's highly ranked restaurant lists. So restaurants with a Michelin star are expected to welcome more customers, benefiting the industry. Sona in New York City, owned by celebrity Priyanka Chopra, has also garnered much attention since its opening. For instance, the restaurant has been frequented by many Hollywood stars like Sophie Turner, Kal Penn and Mindy Kaling, according to HELLO! India."
