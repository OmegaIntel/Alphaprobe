    "executive_summary": "The Methanol Production industry produces the organic chemical, methanol, for uses in plastics, paints, and fuel. Methanol is primarily produced by reforming natural gas then converting and distilling the resulting gas yielding a clear, liquid, organic chemical. This makes production sensitive to changes in the price of natural gas. Industry operators produce methanol in use in consumer products, medical products, and fuel sectors. Key buying industries are driven by consumer demand, meaning consumer spending indirectly affects operators in this industry. As consumer demand rose in 2021 as the COVID-19 (coronavirus) pandemic slowed down, so did demand from key buying industries. Moreover, an increase in global demand for methanol sharply increased the amount of industry exports, resulting in revenue growth despite lows experienced by the coronavirus. Revenue is estimated to increase an annualized 4.9% to $3.7 billion over the five years to 2022, including an increase of 3.7% in 2022.",
