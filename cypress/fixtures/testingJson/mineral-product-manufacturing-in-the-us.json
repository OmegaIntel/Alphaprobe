Manufacturers benefited during the current period from high wages and low unemployment, which caused aggregate private investment to gain. Higher private investment enabled companies to spend more on nonresidential construction, boosting downstream demand for the industry. Private investment fell during the COVID-19 pandemic, which caused revenue to slump in 2020.",

Since consumers were spending heavily, corporate profit was high so private investment surged. Elevated private investment caused corporations to invest more in office space and other types of nonresidential construction, increasing the need for mineral products and causing revenue to skyrocket in 2019."

As fewer households spent on manufactured goods, companies didn't need as many mineral products to produce them, so the COVID-19 pandemic caused revenue to creep downward."

This has reduced the number of products manufacturers can ship to other countries, reducing manufacturers' revenue streams. The US dollar has also appreciated, making domestically produced goods more expensive to foreign buyers and reducing exports and sales for manufacturers."
