    "executive_summary": "Operators in the Ice Cream Stores industry serve dessert-craving customers a range of frozen treats, including ice cream, gelato and sorbet, as well as various toppings, ranging from crushed candies to flavored syrups. Despite increased per capita disposable income and per capita dairy consumption, ice cream stores have experienced a modest decline in demand over the past five years. With rising inflation pushing ice cream prices higher, consumers have opted for the ice cream gallons at the supermarkets, leaving the fresh-scooped cones or bowls offered at local ice cream shops. In addition, in 2020, industry revenue fell as consumers increased stock-up activity at supermarkets and visited industry establishments less due to the pandemic. Customers have gradually been returning to industry establishments considering growing vaccination rates, boosting industry",

Still, consumers hesitated to visit industry establishments amid nationwide lockdown measures and turned to groceries or supermarkets to buy pints as stock-up activity has risen. Some consumers turned to comfort food amid the pandemic, which helped mitigate the industry's decline."

Over the past five years, per capita dairy consumption has increased, supporting industry growth. In addition, disposable income has also climbed over the past five years, resulting in climbing industry revenue. During summer, ice cream shops typically experience increased demand for frozen treats."

Consumers have become less health-conscious, contributing to limited demand declines and industry revenue growth. Despite a decline in the healthy eating index, ice cream shops are experiencing increasing competition from shops that provide healthier alternatives to ice creams, with most of this competition stemming from frozen yogurt stores."

While ice cream shops struggled during the pandemic, take-out option expansions have given consumers the opportunity to bring ice cream back home with no delivery charge and less risk of melting."

The DPHP recommends keeping total saturated fat consumption low and limiting added sugar consumption to foods high in vitamins and minerals. However, demand for ice cream stores will climb as the healthy eating index declines, boosting industry revenue over the next five years."

With a wheeled cooler and vehicle freezer bought for less than $10,000, ice cream shops can significantly expand their potential market radius. Ice cream is also accepted as one of the essential base desserts and is widely popular among all significant population segments, making ice cream shops ideal candidates for providing desserts to large crowds."
