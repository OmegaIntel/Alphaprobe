Inpatient psychiatric facilities received 2.3% of government payments to all hospitals in 2020. The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) adjusted its Medicare payment 2022 policies and rates for the Inpatient Psychiatric Facility (IPF) Prospective Payment System (PPS) by 2.0%.

For some hospitals, heightened regulation stemming from the Affordable Care Act encouraged acquisition activity because larger companies can more effectively pool resources, eliminate redundancies and cut costs to meet budget goals. Increased consolidation activity, in turn, encouraged merger and acquisition activity as healthcare companies sought growth to remain competitive with one another and retain bargaining power with suppliers and payers. Despite increased consolidation, a nationwide shortage of nurses and psychologists has increased wages as industry enterprises vie for critical staff."
