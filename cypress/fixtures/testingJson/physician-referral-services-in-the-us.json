    "executive_summary": "Figures have been adjusted for inflation and are presented in 2024 currency. Revenue has grown, this growth is a result of consistent increases in healthcare expenditure and medical cost inflation, in addition to a decline in the uninsured rate. People on insurance are more likely to be in need of physician referral services. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, there was as an influx of health insurance enrollment through expanded Medicaid eligibility. In the past five years, industry revenue grew at a CAGR of 3.6% to $1.9 billion, including a 1.3% increase in 2024 alone, when profit increased to 6.8%. In 2017, several of the key aspects of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) were repealed. The most significant for this industry was the repeal of the health insurance mandate, which required all individuals to either purchase health insurance or pay a penalty. Without this mandate, demand for private health insurance has slowly decreased. Physician's referral services revenue will grow at a CAGR of 4.0% to $3.4 billion over the next five years. Key sources of growth include medical cost inflation and increased demand from the aging US population. As the baby boomer generation ages, more people will need medical coverage, and the retirement of baby boomers will particularly increase Medicare expenditure, which is likely to increase need for physician referral services.",

Since specialists rely on referrals to generate business, physician referral developers fill a vital role, especially for new physicians. Referral service companies also work with insurance providers to create physician networks that simplify the referral process. The pandemic is over. Increased medical visits, beyond emergencies and time sensitive issues, since the pandemic is increasing demand for physician referral services. This increased activity has helped increase revenue for physician referral servicers in recent years."

Most significantly, consolidation within the healthcare sector reduces the need for referral networks. Doctors within healthcare networks are more likely to refer patients to other physicians within the same network, and the larger the network is, the more likely it is to have the needed specialist. Consolidation in the healthcare sector is likely to continue in the next couple of years. Large life insurers will likely continue to consolidate to boost revenue, efficiency and profitability. The smaller life insurers who are willing to fight for market share will need to provide newer services and find niche roles in the industry."
