Homebuilders received a large chunk of the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) to cover payroll expenses. They had to ensure their employees were working in a safe environment to prevent the additional spread of the virus. Historically low interest rates and a low housing stock led to an influx of private investors starting new housing projects."

The cost of materials skyrocketed following the pandemic as supply chain issues posed a threat. The price of steel, in particular, nearly doubled."
