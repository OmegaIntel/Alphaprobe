The industry is highly competitive, heavily concentrated and led by MSA Safety Inc., the global leader in industry device production. Industry growth is largely determined by the health of downstream markets, including mining and manufacturing sectors. These industries use gas detectors to monitor systems and environments to alert workers of hazardous conditions.\n\nOver the five years to 2020, gradually improving energy prices encouraged energy producers to invest in exploration and production projects, supporting industry growth. However, as macroeconomic conditions deteriorated alongside the emergence of the COVID-19 (coronavirus) pandemic, demand for industry products retracted. IBISWorld expects industry revenue to decline an annualized 2.6% to $289.9 million during the period, including a fall of 17.8% in 2020 alone.",
