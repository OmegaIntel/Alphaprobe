    "executive_summary": "The Adhesive Manufacturing industry has undergone significant fluctuations over the last few years, largely influenced by the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. The global crisis led to reduced industrial activities, resulting in dampened adhesive manufacturing revenues and profits in 2020. However, the following year saw a surge in manufacturers' inventory buildup, in response to economic uncertainty that had been spurred by high inflation and disruptions in the supply chain. This adjustment in the broader manufacturing sector contributed to double-digit growth within this industry in 2021. Robust expansion in residential construction, which benefited from historically low mortgage rates at the time, further buoyed growth.",

As industrial sector businesses worked to navigate the evolving macroeconomic conditions by increasing their inventories, there was a notable uptick in demand for adhesives in 2021."
