    "executive_summary": "Automobile steering and suspension manufacturers primarily produce and rebuild motor vehicle steering and suspension systems and components, including steering wheels, shock absorbers and struts. The industry struggled through the current period, enduring severe travel restrictions, unfavorable trade conditions and weak economic growth. In particular, the pandemic and climbing interest rates bracketed a brief period of torrid new car sales. Similarly, global supply chain disruptions led to notable profit declines as companies struggled to source materials and pass unexpected costs onto buyers. Overall, revenue plummeted at an expected CAGR of 2.9% to $15.7 through the current period, stagnating in 2024, where profit rebounded to 2.7%. Innovation across the automotive sector has created demand for innovative products to support the development of electric and autonomous vehicles. These products require more complex designs, often resulting in close collaboration between parts and vehicle manufacturers. This trend has helped to shield domestic manufacturers from increasing foreign pressure; even so, imports have satisfied an increasing portion of domestic demand, especially for low-cost, generic parts. Rebounding economic conditions, highlighted by normalizing interest rates, robust consumer confidence and a favorable trade-weighted index, will contribute to the industry's strong growth through the outlook period. Similarly, waning input costs will provide significant stability to supply chains, enabling manufacturers to generate stronger returns. Government spending on public transportation and electric vehicles will also create demand for new vehicles, contributing to elevated demand for related steering and suspension parts. Overall, revenue will rebound at an estimated CAGR of 1.8% to $17.2 billion through the current period.",

            "current_performance_point_title": "The pandemic limited growth opportunities",
            "current_performance_point_description": "The pandemic weakened consumer markets, cutting spending on big-ticket items like automobiles and repairs; similarly, poor economic conditions and weak corporate profit constrained demand from businesses purchasing new trucks, company cars and other vehicles, like farming or construction vehicles. Lockdown restrictions also limited travel opportunities, creating less demand for travel and repairs. Governments have since lifted stay-at-home orders, enabling consumers to express pent-up demand for travel, leading to temporarily soaring demand for new and used cars and requiring more steering and suspension parts. Even so, climbing interest rates have threatened automotive supply chains. Many buyers rely on loans to purchase a new vehicle; high rates have deterred borrowing, dampening shifting travel trends."

        {
            "current_performance_point_title": "Manufacturers have grappled with volatile supply chains",
            "current_performance_point_description": "The pandemic and the Russian invasion of Ukraine have led to severe input cost volatility and prolonged global supply chain disruptions. In particular, crude oil and steel prices climbed to near-record levels through the current period before slowly receding in 2023 and 2024. Supply chain disruptions have piled onto poor economic performance, leading to notable profit declines; many companies, especially smaller, independent competitors, struggled to pass costs onto buyers, instead absorbing costs at the detriment of profit growth. Larger companies also struggled to remain profitable in 2021, given the global nature of supply chain disruptions. In general, Russian sanctions have eliminated a major supplier of crude oil alongside ferrous and nonferrous metals, limiting supplier options. Overall, manufacturers have struggled to elevate profit to pre-pandemic levels given economic uncertainty and continued supply chain issues."

        {
            "current_performance_point_title": "The proliferation of electric vehicles encourages upstream innovation",
            "current_performance_point_description": "Electric vehicle innovation has created new opportunities for automobile steering and suspension manufacturers to collaborate with automakers and establish themselves as vital parts of the EV manufacturing supply chain alongside traditional combustion vehicle supply chains. In general, suspension systems have few differences between combustion and electric-powered vehicles; in comparison, EVs have an average curb weight of 20% to 30% greater than vehicles with internal combustion vehicles, requiring more power to steer. These changes have opportunities to partner with EV manufacturers to create lighter, more efficient steering systems. More effective steering systems prevent car crashes, helping manufacturers build stronger buyer relationships."

            "future_outlook_point_description": "The economy will recover from the pandemic and high interest rates through the outlook period, encouraging consumers and businesses to purchase new vehicles, stimulating demand for related suspension and steering equipment. Consumers will also have more funds to travel, leading to more wear and tear on vehicles and creating demand from aftermarkets for parts and repairs. More leisure time may also encourage consumers to take short road trips, furthering demand for repairs. Even so, Kelly Blue Book reports that suspension and steering repairs tend to be more costly than other repairs. Suspension repair can cost between $1,000 and $5,000, while power steering pump replacements cost around $900. These repairs are often less frequent than others but may represent a hurdle moving forward. Recovering supply chains will also improve the outlook for automobile steering and suspension manufacturers. Lower input prices will enable manufacturers to reduce production costs while expanding profitability. Automation will also bolster profit and reduce labor costs."

            "future_outlook_point_description": "Steering and suspension parts are relatively light and cost-effective to shop overseas, contributing to the industry's robust international trade landscape. Manufacturers in low-cost countries, like China and Mexico, have taken advantage of lax labor and environmental regulations to flood domestic markets with inexpensive parts and equipment. Favorable exchange rates will enable domestic manufacturers to regain some ground from foreign competitors through the outlook period, but lower costs will remain a pervasive threat to the domestic industry. Increased specialization in products that pair with electric and autonomous vehicles will also create more niches for high-tech, custom-built suspension and steering products. This trend will likely support growth in the domestic industry."

        {
            "future_outlook_point_title": "Companies will continue to move production offshore",
            "future_outlook_point_description": "While the United States has historically been a major hub for automakers and their upstream suppliers, climbing operational and compliance costs have encouraged automobile manufacturers to open facilities in lower-cost countries, contributing to already elevated import penetration. Specifically, Mexico has become a major automotive sector hub in North America, supplying cars across North and South America. At the same time, companies take advantage of favorable government policies, lower labor costs and fewer manufacturing regulations. Many suppliers, including automobile steering and suspension manufacturers, will increasingly relocate to increase proximity to downstream automakers, enabling them to reap the same benefits as auto producers and cut transportation costs."

Companies also need rubbers and plastics for final products. Manufacturers faced severe supply chain disruptions following the pandemic and the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Higher costs heavily diminished returns for most manufacturers; even so, successful manufacturers were able to pass added costs onto buyers, limiting supply chain volatility."

Even so, companies have continued to automate production tasks to reduce their reliance on low-wage labor.
