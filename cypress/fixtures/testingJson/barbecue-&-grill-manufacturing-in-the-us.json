    "executive_summary": "Barbecue and grill producers have endured some volatility in recent years. Since individuals and households are the most common end-market for grills, demand for new products is closely tied to the health of the residential construction sector and other macroeconomic factors, like disposable income and consumer confidence. Domestic producers benefited from activity in residential real estate during the initial stages of the pandemic when near-zero interest rates led to jumps in the value of residential construction. Demand for the construction sector weakened because drastic interest rate hikes pushed long-term borrowing costs higher, contributing to falling grill sales. Similarly, elevated inflation in 2022 pushed consumers to postpone discretionary purchases like barbecues. However, losses during the period failed to reverse pandemic-related gains. As a result, revenue has grown at an estimated CAGR of 3.2% to $2.1 billion through 2024, including a 3.6% dip that year alone.",
