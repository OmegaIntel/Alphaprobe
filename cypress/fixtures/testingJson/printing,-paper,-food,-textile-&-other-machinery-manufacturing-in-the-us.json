Demand hinges on activity in discrete downstream markets, as downstream producers purchase machinery in response to domestic and international demand for manufactured goods. Due to this, the industry is influenced by the overall level of industrial production and the amount of private investment in industrial equipment across the economy.",

Supply chain efficiencies, lower wage costs and fewer regulations have enabled manufacturers in foreign countries to produce machinery at lower prices than their US counterparts. In turn, these savings are passed on to the consumer in the form of lower prices, siphoning revenue away from domestic manufacturers."
