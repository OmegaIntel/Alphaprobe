    "executive_summary": "The Internet Radio Broadcasting industry's main revenue comes from online advertising from existing over-the-air radio stations and recommendation-based streaming platforms like Pandora. The industry doesn't include on-demand services like Spotify that let users select their music. Over the past five years, these platforms have become major competitors and have siphoned money and listeners away from the industry. The pandemic exacerbated this as consumers spent their money elsewhere while trapped indoors. With more people staying home, funds were redirected towards essential goods, streaming services and more interactive forms of home entertainment, causing a dip in advertising revenues for internet radio platforms reliant on commercial sponsors.",
