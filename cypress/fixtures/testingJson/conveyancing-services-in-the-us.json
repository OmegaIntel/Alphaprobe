    "executive_summary": "Over the five years to 2024, the Conveyancing Services industry has experienced volatility in line with fluctuations in the housing market and interest rates. This industry comprises companies and legal practitioners that provide conveyancing services to individuals and corporate clients. Conveyancing, the process of transferring ownership of land or property from one person or entity to another, requires specialists to advise parties, prepare documentation, and conduct the settlement process. From 2019 to 2021, the industry experienced strong growth fueled by rising housing starts and increased home sales. Nonetheless, in 2022, the Federal Reserve began to raise interest rates to combat inflation, which has cooled off the housing market substantially, causing demand to plummet in 2022 and 2023. Overall, industry revenue is anticipated to rise at a CAGR of 0.1% over the past five",

            "current_performance_point_description": "A strong housing market with a high volume of property sales translates directly into more work for conveyancers. The US housing market boomed from 2019 to 2021 because of a confluence of factors creating a perfect storm of high demand and limited supply, driving up prices. Low interest rates, a limited housing stock and increased investor activity caused a flurry of residential real estate transactions, spurring robust demand for conveyancing services."

            "current_performance_point_description": "However, in response to inflation, the Federal Reserve began to raise interest rates in 2022. Rising interest rates, combined with high home prices, have dampened affordability and existing home sales fell in 2022 and 2023. Demand for conveyancing services followed suit, as fewer transactions reduced demand for conveyancing services. The real estate market is poised for a rebound in 2024, as anticipated cuts to interest rates will likely spur an increase in real estate transactions, bolstering demand for conveyancing services."

            "current_performance_point_description": "Demand for conveyancing services from businesses is a complex interplay of economic factors, real estate market conditions, and internal business decisions. Mergers and acquisitions often involve property transfers, requiring conveyancing services to ensure legal compliance. COVID-19 caused economic uncertainty, leading some businesses to postpone property transactions, stunting demand for conveyancing services from businesses in 2020. As restrictions eased and economic activity recovered, pent-up demand for property transactions materialized. This resulted in a surge in demand for conveyancing services in some areas in 2021. As interest rates have risen, tight credit conditions have made it difficult for businesses to secure financing for property transactions, reducing demand for conveyancing services."

This is anticipated to provide much-needed relief to the residential real estate market, as falling mortgage rates will likely stimulate greater home sales, bolstering demand for conveyancing services. Lower interest rates can make real estate a more attractive investment option compared to other assets like bonds. This might encourage investors to enter the market, purchasing properties to rent out or resell for a profit. Increased investor activity translates to more property transactions and a higher need for conveyancing services."

AI is expected to go beyond basic document review. We might see AI used for more complex tasks like risk identification, title insurance underwriting, and even preliminary legal due diligence. Clients will likely expect even greater transparency and clear communication throughout the conveyancing process. This could involve providing online portals for tracking progress, regular updates, and readily available resources to educate clients on legal jargon. Cost-conscious consumers might drive a demand for tiered service options or a rise in online conveyancing services that offer lower fees."

Smaller conveyancing firms might struggle to compete with larger firms or those embracing technology. We will likely see consolidation within the industry as firms merge or acquire each other to gain a competitive edge. To stand out operators will likely focus on building expertise in specific areas like commercial property or complex transactions to attract more clients seeking niche services. Robust cybersecurity measures and data protection protocols will be essential to ensure client trust and compliance with regulations."

            "question": "How do you ensure that your company's pricing policy is appropriate? How have pricing methods changed in recent years?",

            "question": "Do changes in the mortgage rates affect your overall level of demand?",
            "answer": "Lower mortgage rates typically increased demand for housing, since lower interest rates reduce the cost of borrowing. All things equal, higher demand for housing increases demand for industry operators who are involved in the sale process."
