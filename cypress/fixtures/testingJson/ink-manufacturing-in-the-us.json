The industry has come under pressure as traditional forms of printed media have continued their long-term contraction. The transition to digital media has had profound implications for the industry. Demand for all publishing has suffered while print advertising expenditure has contracted, suppressing industry demand. The industry slumped at a CAGR of 5.8% to $4.0 billion over the past five years, including an expected decline of 5.5% in 2024, alone. The pandemic exacerbated poor conditions, encouraging remote workspaces and normalizing online advertising instead of print.",
