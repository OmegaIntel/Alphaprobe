Cremation is relatively new in Western history; many religions have traditionally favored or even mandated the interment of human remains. In 1960, fewer than 5.0% of Americans were cremated upon death, while funerals today are split almost evenly between burial and cremation. Over time, a softening stance on cremation by some religions, notably the Catholic Church, has contributed to a more favorable view of cremation among Americans; however, many religions still oppose the practice. Meanwhile, the declining religiosity of the US population has made these concerns less relevant; according to Pew Research, 26.0% of US adults did not identify with a religion in 2019, up from 23.0% in 2009 (latest data available). Fewer funerals have conformed to religious traditions, enabling more consumers to opt for cremation."

The lower cost of cremation has made it an attractive option for many consumers."

Since heating could not be controlled effectively, cremation was potentially dangerous and the time necessary to completely dispose of a body was irregular. New cremation systems employ natural or propane gases that are regulated by computers to optimize temperature. Complex algorithms manage heating cycles based on the size and composition of the body, ensuring the timely incineration of the body and eliminating mixing human remains with those from spent fuels. Knowing when a cremation will occur enables providers to schedule services and maximize available resources. Advanced technology also allows cremation systems to process gases, removing odors and potentially dangerous pollutants. Many new systems integrate a secondary burning chamber that removes any remaining organic material from exhaust gases."
