    "executive_summary": "The Insect Repellent Manufacturing industry produces consumer products that deter insects from landing on a particular surface. Consumers purchase repellents to avoid insect bites and prevent insect-borne diseases. Industry products range from skin applicants to aerosol sprays for clothing. Over the five years to 2022, quelled fears of disease transmission and waning domestic manufacturing have contributed to a decline in industry revenue. Manufacturers are introducing plant-based repellents to attract environmentally conscious consumers and appeal to shifting tastes against potentially toxic chemical inputs. The industry has also experienced increased offshoring to low-income countries, undermining domestic manufacturing.",
