    "executive_summary": "The Aerial Work Platform Manufacturing industry has declined over the five years to 2022, albeit with significant volatility from year to year. Industry demand is primarily driven by construction activity because aerial work platforms are used by nearly all construction industries. Additionally, the largest buyer of industry goods is construction equipment rental companies. As downstream demand from most construction markets increased as the five-year period began, rental companies sought to increase their stock, boosting revenue. However, the onset of the COVID-19 (coronavirus) pandemic and subsequent decline in construction activity severely hampered industry revenue in 2020, with revenue falling 39.4% in 2020 alone. Over the five years to 2022, industry revenue is expected to decrease at an annualized rate of 4.1% to $4.9 billion, despite an expected 8.5% rise in 2022 due to an uptick in construction activity.",

            "answer": "Manufacturing costs: Manufacturing incurs substantial purchasing and production costs that are usually dictated by forces outside a company's control (e.g. steel prices). Operators can increase profitability by managing these costs and operating efficiently. Reputation: Do you have a strong reputation among customers? Are you known for your reliability and performance? Having a good reputation. Product quality: How do you maintain product quality? Do you have systems in place to keep standards high and continually updating? If you have had production errors, how did you deal with them? Effective quality control: Effective quality control adds value to a company's brand names by establishing a level of consistency among products. Steel prices: When steel prices rise, how much of the added cost are you able to pass on to customers? How have you maintained profit during periods of high steel prices and low demand? World price of steel: Steel is a major input material for this industry. When the price of steel is high, industry operators experience higher raw material costs. This lets operators pass down these costs to consumers in the form of higher prices, which causes revenue to rise."

            "question": "How much of your revenue is generated from exports? Do you compete in the domestic market with any foreign companies?",
            "answer": "Trade-weighted index: The trade-weighted index (TWI) measures the strength of the US dollar against the currencies of major trading partners. When the TWI increases, it signals an appreciation of the dollar, which makes domestic goods relatively more expensive compared with their international counterparts."

        {
            "question": "To which construction markets do you primarily supply products? How have these markets trended in your region in recent years?",
            "answer": "Value of construction: Aerial work platforms are primarily used during construction. As a result, demand for industry products is heavily driven by the value of construction, which measures the total value of construction work done in the United States. Typically, industry operators benefit from high construction spending because more work platforms are needed."
