Reinsurers help protect health insurers against major medical expenses. Reinsurers assume some of the risk associated with health insurance policies from primary carriers, meaning that industry operators pay a portion of policy claims and receive a percentage of policy premiums in return. In addition to premium revenue, reinsurers earn investment income; the industry is thus influenced by trends in both healthcare and financial markets.",

All of these factors affect demand for reinsurance, as surplus determines how much capacity an industry has to write new business. If capacity is constrained in the primary insurance markets, demand for reinsurance is generally higher, because insurers will seek to pass on a greater proportion of risk to maintain adequate capital reserves."

            "question": "What international operations do you conduct and how could you benefit from increasing your international reach?",
            "answer": "Some large companies are able to provide reinsurance for overseas companies. Congress is also contemplating further legislation that will increase the tax burden on foreign-owned US insurance companies that purchase reinsurance from an alien affiliate. The purpose of this proposal is to \"level the playing field\" between domestically-owned and foreign-owned US insurance companies. The legislation's ultimate impact would be to end the use of offshore affiliate reinsurance. This would result in the level of reinsurance service imports into the US market contracting substantially. Consequently, demand for the Health and Medical Reinsurance industry's services would increase as companies would need to fill the void brought on by the decrease in foreign reinsurance coverage. As a result of this forecast trend, the proposed tax could be viewed as industry assistance. However, the reinsurance industry is interconnected and the decrease in foreign-owned reinsurance options would substantially decrease the industry's ability to spread risk."
