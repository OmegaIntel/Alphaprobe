    "executive_summary": "Hydraulic fracturing service providers have recently been on a roller coaster ride of sorts. The COVID-19 pandemic initially hit them hard as travel restrictions and safety measures led to a considerable slowing of industries across the board. This noticeably reduced the need for fossil fuels. However, as restrictions were lifted and travel resumed, companies enjoyed a precipitous recovery. Events such as Russia's invasion of Ukraine in 2022 served to further elevate prices and ramp up production in the US. Industry revenue has been increasing at a CAGR of 5.5% over the past five years to total an estimated $33.6 billion, including an estimated increase of 3.4% in 2024.",

These measures kept people at home and slowed nearly all industries, drastically cutting down the need for fossil fuels.

Many state governments are also tightening regulations on hydraulic fracturing and the industry may be subject to more stringent regulation in the future. The need for additional permits and other regulatory measures can potentially cut into the industry profit margin."
