    "executive_summary": "The Movie Rental Kiosks industry comprises establishments (kiosks) that rent DVDs, Blu-ray discs and video games. Kiosks are stand-alone, automated vending machines generally located near grocery stores and drug stores. Over the five years to 2021, the industry has suffered from a continued decline in demand for physical media as consumers have increasingly adopted digital and online platforms for media viewing. During the period, revenue for the Movie Rental Kiosks industry is estimated to decline an annualized 19.0% to $704.6 million in 2021, including a 3.4% decrease in 2021 alone. Profit is expected to decrease with revenue. The large decrease in revenue is primarily a reflection of the significant decrease in revenue reported by Redbox Automated Retail LLC (Redbox) in 2018. Additionally, the COVID-19 (coronavirus) pandemic is expected to further push down revenue.",

            "question": "How do licensing agreements with major studios affect your business?",
            "answer": "The contracts with major studios influence when Redbox is permitted to begin renting out new release films, whose availability drives demand for movies. In addition, the licensing agreements also affect the level of profit by setting a percentage of revenue that Redbox must pay to the studios."
        },
        {
            "question": "How can you maintain superior service while reducing operating costs?",

            "question": "Does the overall level of consumer spending affect demand for your industry? How do you stimulate demand when spending is low?",
            "answer": "During economic downturns, the inevitable spike in unemployment leads to declining consumption. When consumer spending is high, consumers will be more likely to spend money on discretionary purchases, like movie rentals. In 2021, consumer spending is expected to increase. This follows a decrease in 2020 due to the COVID-19 (coronavirus) pandemic."
        },
        {
            "question": "Does the level of population density generate higher revenue or improve the efficiency of your operations? How popular is your company in cities?",
            "answer": "Over the past five years, more people have been shifting to metro areas, creating more densely populated areas with higher foot traffic. This benefits industry operators, as exposure remains a major basis of competition within the industry. In 2021, the urban population is expected to increase."
