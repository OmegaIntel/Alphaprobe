In recent years, a record-high pet ownership rate and shifting attitudes have boosted spending on pet care services, including hospice services. The broader pet care sector has flourished as pet owners sought the best for their pets. The industry's growth trajectory was not even disrupted by the COVID-19 pandemic. Despite work-from-home settings and travel restrictions, pet owners still utilized hospice services when needed. An unprecedented spike in pet ownership during the pandemic has shifted the industry's landscape, with demand for pet hospice services outpacing supply post-COVID. Pet owners' steep spending on pets has led industry-wide revenue to expand at a CAGR of 3.7% over the past five years, totaling an estimated $317.4 million, including an expected 0.8% increase in 2024.",
