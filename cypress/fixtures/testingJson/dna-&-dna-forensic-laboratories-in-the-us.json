Recent technological developments have enabled laboratories to lower the costs of running DNA tests, making them more accessible and enabling laboratories to become more profitable. These developments also led to the rising use of at-home DNA testing, making it more affordable for consumers and boosting demand for discretionary testing services, such as non-court required paternity tests, ancestry tests and veterinary testing.",
