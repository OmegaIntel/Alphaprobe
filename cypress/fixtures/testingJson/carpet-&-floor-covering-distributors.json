    "executive_summary": "The Carpet and Floor Covering Distributors industry includes companies that wholesale carpet, wood tile and other materials used to cover existing floors. Primarily, this industry focuses on the distribution of installed carpets and area rugs, with those products generating the majority of industry revenue. Over the five years to 2022, this industry has struggled due to a combination of waning downstream demand and volatile input costs. Most significantly, at the height of the COVID-19 (coronavirus) pandemic in 2020, the world price of cotton plummeted, causing industry input costs to fall. However, due to the high price-based competition of the industry, distributors were forced to reduce prices, leading to a significant revenue decrease, while industry profit remained stable. Additionally, while economic recovery in 2021 supported industry revenue growth, surging home prices are expected to cause housing starts and home renovations to drop off in 2022. Residential construction, including both new homes and renovations of existing homes, is a significant driver of industry demand because many new homes install carpeting, and renovations may involve converting the floors through the use of floor coverings. As a result of this decline, industry revenue is expected to fall an estimated 2.1% in 2022.",

In 2020, the pandemic alone. This downward pressure on the industry, coupled with the disruption of the pandemic, has outweighed positive demand trends during the period. As a result, industry revenue is expected to decline at an annualized rate of 0.8% to $34.6 billion over the five years to 2022."

The pandemic has also contributed to more people moving out of cities and into suburban areas due to opportunities for office workers to work remotely. This resulted in a surge in housing starts and home sales in 2021. However, this trend is expected to quickly wane in 2022 as home prices skyrocket. As a result, housing starts are expected to decline in 2022, contributing to industry revenue falling 2.1% the same year."

Currently, wood floors are in higher demand than carpets among home buyers. According to 2020 data from the National Association of Realtors, 54.0% of home buyers are willing to pay higher prices for a home with hardwood floors (latest data available). This trend has posed a mild threat to industry operations because installed carpet carries a higher price tag than area rugs, which would be necessary in homes with hardwood floors."

In fact, the value of nonresidential construction will likely grow at an annualized rate of 1.8% over the five years to 2027. However, the effects of this growth will be limited because nonresidential buildings typically use lower cost floor coverings. Some consumers do not use floor coverings, such as more durable carpeting or linoleum."

However, stabilization from downstream markets is also expected to support steady profit, making companies less likely to exit the industry.
