    "executive_summary": "The BBQ and Outdoor Cooking Stores industry has been rekindled over the past five years. Rising per capita disposable income and leisure time have revived discretionary purchases on outdoor cooking equipment such as barbecues (BBQs), smokers and related accessories. As the economy continues its recovery, consumers have higher propensity to purchase new equipment to replace the aging equipment that they already own or purchase secondhand items. Equipment sold by operators tends to have a relatively long lifespan but is susceptible to wear and tear, so consumers continue to replace or upgrade outdoor cooking equipment every few years. Although economic conditions deteriorated amid COVID-19, a spike in at-home cooking and stay-at-home orders have bolstered demand. These trends caused revenue to heighten at a CAGR of 2.9% to an estimated $9.6 billion through the end of 2023, including a drop of 1.9% in 2023, driven by growth in residential construction and outdoor cooking upgrades as the economy continues to recover post-pandemic.",

However, rising incomes and a larger market for luxury goods have enticed many new niche businesses into the marketplace. These trends, coupled with growing online availability, heightened competition for operators. Despite numerous small specialty operators entering the industry during the five-year period, big-box retailers remain core controllers of their share of revenue.
