    "executive_summary": "Car body shops repair and customize motor vehicle interiors and bodies. Companies have benefited from pent-up demand for travel and driving alongside mass returns to in-person work. These trends have spurred driving activity, highlighted by more vehicle miles and motor vehicle registrations. Similarly, rebounding economic conditions have encouraged buyers to purchase more discretionary services, like painting, detailing and upholstery. However, climbing inflation has added to volatility through the current period. Elevated interest rates have made cars more expensive, encouraging consumers to repair aging vehicles rather than replace them, supporting demand. Even so, inflationary fears have discouraged discretionary spending, especially among lower earners, siphoning demand for nonessential services.",

For example, shops will use digital price estimation and quotation methods to enhance precision in cost calculations and boost transparency in billing.

Electric vehicles are often more complex than combustion-engine vehicles, leading to more expensive and labor-intensive repairs. Car body shops offering EV services may gain a competitive advantage as the market shifts. Companies may need to purchase new diagnostic tools and invest in EV-specific training programs, adding to costs.
