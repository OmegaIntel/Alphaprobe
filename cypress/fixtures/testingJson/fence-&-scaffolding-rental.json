        {
            "question": "Have the rising prices of key construction inputs significantly affected profit margins in recent years?",
            "answer": "Operators profit margins tend to rely on the price they can charge down stream construction markets, thus if downstream construction markets are diminished due to rising input prices, industry profit margins will struggle as well. Many industry operators rely heavily on the price of steel, to create the rent-able products, and the price of diesel, to transport said products."
