This has also been the industry's traditional business segment, as ride-sharing is often most profitable when the distance to the airport is relatively short. Fuel costs are lower for operators in this segment, which often results in greater per-mile profitability as operators are able to charge a fixed price regardless of fuel costs. However, competition within this segment is greater than for long-distance travel because consumers have a variety of options to arrive at an airport, depending on the city's infrastructure. In many cases, a consumer can choose between a subway or bus system, taxi and limousine services and driving themselves to or from the airport, as alternatives to using the industry's services for local services.
