    "executive_summary": "The Cotton Farming industry has experienced extremely volatile operating conditions over the past five years. Surging commodity prices immediately following the pandemic contributed to a partial resurgence but made substitutes more attractive. Trade wars and an appreciating dollar caused exports to fall. Since exports constitute a significant source of revenue for cotton farmers, their poor performance negatively impacted operators. As interest rates have risen recently, cotton farmers have held off on purchasing better machines, hindering crop yields. Overall, revenue for cotton farmers is forecast to creep up at a CAGR of only 0.2% to $8.3 billion over the five years to 2024. However, the Federal Reserve is expected to lower interest rates by the end of 2024, driving downstream demand and allowing cotton farmers to invest in new equipment. In 2024, revenue is expected to grow an estimated 18.1%. Cotton farmers will face a resurgence over the next five years, as steadily rising incomes will boost downstream demand, aiding revenue. Commodity prices will be less volatile, so farmers won't face as many revenue drops resulting from the plunging price of cotton. Since the US dollar will depreciate, exports will recover, benefiting operators. Innovations, such as biotechnology, precision agriculture and new pesticides, will increase crop yields, raising sales for farmers. Overall, revenue for cotton farmers is forecast to rise at a CAGR of 5.4% to $10.7 billion over the five years to 2029, when profit is expected to account for 21.0% of revenue, a strong increase from five years prior.",

            "current_performance_point_description": "Cotton farms benefit from increases in the world price of cotton because demand for cotton is inelastic enough that farms generate higher revenue when prices rise. Immediately following the pandemic, prices soared as supply chain disruptions created a shortage of cotton. When prices rose, so did revenue. Cotton prices have begun to decline, returning to a more stable place but driving revenue back down from their inflated position."

Since exports comprise most of the industry's revenue, their poor performance has caused revenue to contract. As trade relations with China improved, China removed its tariffs on cotton, allowing the value of exports to return to growth."

When borrowing costs are higher, farmers are less likely to purchase new and better equipment, constraining output. Many downstream cotton buyers won't engage in new investments, reducing downstream demand."
