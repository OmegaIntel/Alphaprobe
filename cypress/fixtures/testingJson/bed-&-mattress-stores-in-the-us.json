    "executive_summary": "The Bed and Mattress Stores industry has expanded strongly over the five years to 2023. Mattresses are ubiquitous products with very few widespread alternatives, which supports relatively consistent expansion. Several factors have come together during the period to accelerate that boost. The primary downstream market for mattress stores is households, and as the residential market saw a post-recessionary jump, visible through boosted consumer spending, confidence, and housing starts, the customer base for mattress stores shot up. Consumers outfitting new homes or moving into existing homes purchased mattresses at a strengthening rate during the current period.",
