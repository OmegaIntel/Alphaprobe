Industry performance over the five years to 2020 can be characterized by strong demand and prices early during the period, followed by a leveling off in 2018 and disruption in 2020 due to the outbreak of COVID-19. Industry revenue is expected to rise an annualized 11.3% to reach $639.6 million. However, this includes an anticipated decline of 0.6% in 2020 alone as end markets are roiled by the coronavirus pandemic.",

This in turn led to lower demand for hops, the key ingredient in beer. However, hops growers limited production in 2020 to adjust for the disruption, leading to higher hops prices and a less severe revenue decline."
