    "executive_summary": "The Fruit and Vegetable Wholesaling industry has experienced moderate revenue growth over the past five years. Wholesalers engaged in the distribution of fresh fruits and vegetables. Revenue is dependent on the market prices of fruits and vegetables in addition to the ability of consumers to spend their incomes at grocery stores and restaurants. Increased per capita disposable income has permitted consumers to purchase more fresh produce from grocery stores and visit restaurants more frequently. Consequentially, demand from downstream industries has grown for much of the period, driving revenue growth for wholesalers. As the economy has reopened, this industry has bounced back significantly, resulting in revenue growing at a CAGR of 4.5% through the end of 2024 to $143.7 billion, including a growth of 19.1% in 2024 alone.",
