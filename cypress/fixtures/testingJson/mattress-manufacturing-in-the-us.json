    "executive_summary": "The mattress manufacturing industry faced volatility during the pandemic. Early on, low interest rates and rising disposable income boosted demand from residential construction. However, later inflation, rate hikes, and economic uncertainty lowered housing demand, hurting mattress sales. Revenue fell at a 0.8% CAGR to $8.5 billion in 2024. Price competition, fluctuating input costs like steel, and imports hurt profitability. Manufacturers moved into e-commerce and direct-to-consumer sales. Consolidation occurred as top players acquired others. Looking ahead, an economic recovery, e-commerce growth, and improved materials/techniques should drive a 1.5% revenue CAGR to $9.1 billion by 2028 as large purchases rebound.",
