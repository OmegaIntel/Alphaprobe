Manufacturers use various bearings, including ball, tapered and spherical products. The industry has experienced multiple headwinds in recent years as weakened downstream markets and rising steel prices have put downward pressure on manufacturers. Overall, revenue has declined at a CAGR of 2.5% to $6.3 billion over the past five years, including an expected increase of 1.3% in 2024.",

The value of imports will drop as the US dollar depreciates, making imports more expensive domestically and exports less expensive internationally. The newly negotiated United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement forces auto manufacturers to source more of their vehicle parts regionally, potentially limiting imports from Europe, Japan and China, which will benefit domestic manufacturers.
