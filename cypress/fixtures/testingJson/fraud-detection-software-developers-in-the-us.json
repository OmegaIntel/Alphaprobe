These models can identify phishing emails or fraudulent customer support interactions missed by traditional rule-based systems. However, advancements in LLMs could also escalate the sophistication and scalability of scams, as malicious actors could exploit them to generate convincing fake communications or deceptive narratives to trick customer service employees."
