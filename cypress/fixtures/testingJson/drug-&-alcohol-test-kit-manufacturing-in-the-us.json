    "executive_summary": "Drug and alcohol test kit manufacturers have benefited in recent years as demand for drug and alcohol test kits has risen. In recent years, growing rates of substance abuse and the penetration of fentanyl into the drug supply has made test kits more critical than ever. Manufacturers' growth was disrupted by the COVID-19 pandemic, as priorities abruptly shifted to combatting the pandemic. Several manufacturers, including industry leader Abbott, pivoted to develop and produce test strips that could detect the virus. Still, elevated rates of substance abuse post-COVID led manufacturers to recover revenue quickly, although global supply chain snags and labor shortages have been challenging to navigate, straining profit.",

The alarming statistic has pressured state governments to act to combat the crisis, with manufacturers developing test strips having a central role. 21 states \u2013 with more expected \u2013 have decriminalized the use of fentanyl test strips, leading more manufacturers to introduce new ones specifically designed to detect the powerful opioid. The increased availability of fentanyl test strips is also bringing more parents and educators to advocate for kits at home and in schools. Elevated need for test kits is offsetting the drop off in THC tests kits in states where recreational marijuana use is legal."

While employer-sanctioned drug tests aren't a part of this industry, sales of drug test kits could slow down as employees feel less inclined to test themselves with at-home kits. At the same time, legalization of marijuana in more and more states has been diminishing the need for test kits detecting THC. Federal officials are loosening drug screening requirements to attract younger workers, with some states barring employers from discriminating against an employee for marijuana use outside of work."
