    "executive_summary": "Figures have been adjusted for inflation and are presented in 2024 currency.\n\nThe DVD, Game and Video Rental industry includes brick-and-mortar operators that primarily engage in renting DVDs, videos and video games. Through the end of 2023, demand for DVD, video and gaming rental services plummeted, as consumers have pivoted to video on demand (VOD) and streaming services, continuing a decade-long trend in this direction. While COVID-19 stay-at-home mandates led to a temporary spike in demand for home entertainment, revenue was still negatively affected because of contamination concerns, social-distancing measures and Hollywood slowing down, which limited the number of new titles that rental servicers could provide. These trends resulted in revenue plummeting 29.4% in 2020 alone. IBISWorld estimates that revenue is expected to collapse at a CAGR of 13.9% to an estimated $1.1 billion through the end of 2023, with a 7.2% plunge expected in 2023.",
