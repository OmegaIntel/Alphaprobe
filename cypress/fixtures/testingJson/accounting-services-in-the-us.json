As revenue has expanded, new accounting service providers have begun operating, increasing competition, especially between smaller companies. The most prominent accounting service providers acquired several smaller companies to boost market share during the high growth early in the period. Accounting services revenue has grown at a CAGR of 1.0% to $146.2 billion over the past five years despite an expected decline of 0.9% in 2024 alone.",
