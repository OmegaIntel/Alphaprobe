The most common metric used to illustrate a competitive technological edge is reducing latency time between trades. Latency is broadly defined as the duration of a process from beginning to end. In this case, it's the moment a stock price appears and the moment it's either purchased or sold. High-frequency trading enterprises generate revenue through disparity in the bid and ask prices for financial securities. Traders that effectively reduce latency time can evaluate price movements and exploit this disparity to make a small profit on each trade. The recent introduction of new methods, such as machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI), has enabled many high-frequency traders to perform these tasks in milliseconds. Companies generally compete to maintain a cutting edge on computing hardware and models."

The most prominent companies in the industry trade in various markets, including public equities, fixed income, currency and commodity exchanges, among others. Diversity in asset classes can reduce overall risk on an enterprise's portfolio, benefiting revenue generated from proprietary trading. Highly diversified players can attract various customers to earn revenue through trade execution commissions, underlining the competitive edge. Traders also compete on geographic location, since proximity to security exchanges can effectively reduce latency times and bolster performance. As a result, larger industry operators typically sustain operations in various geographic locations in accordance with relevant exchanges. For small-scale enterprises, competition for control over a local market is critical for sustainable growth."
