Manufacturers design and produce corrective, cosmetic and therapeutic contact lenses and market them primarily to medical professionals and retailers. Contact lenses are often considered a cosmetic alternative to eyeglasses rather than a necessity, linking demand to consumers' disposable income and health insurance coverage. Industry revenue is expected to increase at an annualized rate of 0.9% to $4.6 billion over the five years to 2021, including a 0.9% increase in 2021.",
