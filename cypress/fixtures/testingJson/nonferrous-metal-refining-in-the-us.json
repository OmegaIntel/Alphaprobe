Nonferrous metal refining is highly globalized and closely linked to activity in the construction and manufacturing sectors, along with being heavily influenced by fluctuations in the price of copper and other nonferrous metals, which often reflect cyclical changes in both domestic and global demand. Despite fluctuating demand from downstream markets, the price of copper and nonferrous metals benefited from significant increases for the majority of the five years to 2024, which has helped the industry as nonferrous metal refiners increased selling prices.",
