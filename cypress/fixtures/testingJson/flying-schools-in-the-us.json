    "executive_summary": "Over the past five years, concerns over a pilot shortage have impacted aviation industries. Airlines worry they can't replace retiring pilots, and early retirements amid COVID-19 pushed these issues to the center of discussion. Meanwhile, the industry's largest union has argued shortages result from low salaries and poor practices, not a lack of pilots. Regardless, airlines grounded nearly a quarter of all flights as a result of staffing issues in 2023. Rising demand for domestic and international travel is perpetuating the shortage as airlines seek to expand operations and drive ticket sales. Pilot salaries are on the rise as employers seek to attract new pilots, leading to heightened enrollment for flying schools. Revenue has been climbing at a CAGR of 3.7% to an estimated $5.5 billion over the five years through 2024, including a rise of 3.2% in 2024 alone.",
