    "executive_summary": "The dairy industry in the US has been a staple of the agricultural sector, consistently contributing to the nation's economy. Over recent years, it has faced a blend of challenges and opportunities. Despite the volatility in milk prices and shifting consumer preferences, the sector has shown resilience. Traditional dairy products like milk, cheese, and yogurt remain household staples, but there's been a noticeable shift towards organic and specialty products. Innovations in production methods and a focus on sustainability have also started to shape the industry's landscape, reflecting broader consumer trends toward healthier and more environmentally friendly options. The industry has been growing at an average annualized 1.1% over the past five years and is expected to total $146.5 billion in 2024 when revenue will dip by an estimated 2.2%.",
