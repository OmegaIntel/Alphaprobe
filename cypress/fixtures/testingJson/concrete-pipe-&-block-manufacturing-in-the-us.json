    "executive_summary": "Figures have been adjusted for inflation and are presented in 2024 currency. The industry has observed substantial growth during the current period, driven by a combination of price increases and higher demand for concrete products. The Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA), in particular, has benefited the industry via a $1.2 trillion investment plan, which was signed in November 2021 and is expected to provide funding through 2026. Cement and concrete prices have experienced rapid growth during the period, driven in part by growing demand from IIJA-funded projects. Overall, concrete pipe and block manufacturing revenue is estimated to grow at a CAGR of 5.7% to $10.3 billion, including 1.9% growth in 2024 alone. Industry profit is estimated to remain at historically high levels driven by elevated manufacturing capacity utilization due to high demand.",

With more projects on the horizon, concrete manufacturing companies are investing in advanced technologies and expanding production capacities, positioning themselves to meet the rising infrastructure-related needs efficiently. The influx of infrastructure projects has led to the creation of numerous jobs within the industry, requiring a skilled workforce to handle increased production, quality control and innovative design practices."

The price of cement tends to be less volatile as compared to commodity prices and generally reflects changes in construction and inflation. The price of cement experienced rapid growth in the second half of the current period, driven a combination of factors, including the government spending on infrastructure projects through 2026. This trend has been mirrored in the pricing of other nonmetallic inputs."

The decline was driven by subdued demand from construction markets, which continue to be impacted by elevated interest rates and mortgage rates. While demand from construction markets is expected to grow in the second half of 2024, offsetting declines in the first half, challenging macroeconomic conditions are expected to decelerate industry growth in that year."
