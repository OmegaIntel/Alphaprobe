    "executive_summary": "The motorcycle, bike and parts manufacturing industry produces two-wheeled vehicles and parts, including on-highway, off-highway and dual motorcycles, scooters, bicycles and parts. As discretionary purchases, demand plummeted during COVID-19 as disposable income fell. Despite a 0.9% revenue jump in 2024 as the economy recovered, overall revenue contracted at an expected CAGR of 2.2% to $6.7 billion through the current period as manufacturers struggled with ballooning input costs. Larger manufacturers were able to pass on costs aiding in recovering demand and profitability.",

The pandemic created economic uncertainty and unprecedented stay-at-home orders, contributing to sharp revenue and profit declines in 2020. For example, leading manufacturers, Harley-Davidson and Kawasaki, struggled to generate positive returns in 2020 as consumers shied away from major purchases."

In particular, spiking crude oil prices have contributed to near-ubiquitous price increases through the supply chain. Large, premium brands, like Harley-Davidson, were able to leverage brand reputations to pass costs onto buyers. In contrast, small manufacturers and more generic bike and parts manufacturers struggled to pass costs onto buyers, contributing to spiking purchase costs and limiting profit for these manufacturers."

Poor economic conditions have encouraged consumers to save more, hindering motorcycle and bike sales. Higher interest rates have also made vehicle loans more costly, preventing consumers from purchasing expensive motorcycles. These economic trends have especially prevented lower-income buyers from purchasing new motorcycles."

The dollar's appreciation has also made imports more attractive for domestic buyers, increasing foreign pressure across lower-cost and high-end manufacturing niches. Foreign manufacturers have leveraged lower costs to gain market share."

Consumers will have more money to spend on new bikes and motorcycles alongside replacement parts. Consumers will also travel more, leading to greater demand for bikes, scooters and motorcycles from rental shops. The Federal Reserve is also expected to lower interest rates through the outlook period, reducing borrowing costs and making it easier for consumers to finance large discretionary purchases."

Baby Boomers have historically represented the largest consumer group for bikes and motorcycles. Many baby boomers are reaching retirement age, which means they spend less money and have less active lifestyles. Manufacturers and downstream retailers will refocus advertising efforts to attract younger customers."

Manufacturers will increasingly offer safety and fuel-efficiency features, like ride-by-wire throttle control, braking systems, advanced rider assistance systems (ARAS) and traction control to appeal to more risk-averse and environmentally-conscious consumers."
