Despite a collapsing labor market in 2020, employment agency revenue expanded at a CAGR of 11.7% in the past five years, including 0.3% growth to reach $46.7 billion in 2023. Additionally, the transition to online work lowers costs and supports profit growth through 2023. Revenue growth was fueled by a 52.0% rise in 2021 alone, as the labor shortage, shift to remote work and economic recovery sparked a surge in demand for employment and recruitment agencies.",

The labor market remains extremely tight. 2020 shocks to labor markets created a shortage of workers as the participation rate stagnated. Companies couldn't find workers to fill positions. Wage hikes haven't quite solved the problem, though hiring pressure has eased. Companies have turned to hiring agencies to help fill recruitment gaps, leading to higher employment and recruiting agency revenue in 2021 and 2022. Revenue surged in 2021, rising 52.0%."

A remote worker in New York is a viable candidate for a hiring company in California. Wage costs have contributed to spiking inflation. To smother the fire, the Federal Reserve began raising interest rates in 2022. Rates remain elevated in 2023, limiting new hires and demand for employment and recruiting agency services."

Agencies can post job openings on multiple job boards with a single click, rather than having to create and post individual job postings on each website. Social media enables small businesses to reach out directly to potential workers. Local social networks can replace Agencies and job boards.

However, higher rates at the start of the five years to 2028 are likely to limit hiring early on. Companies will seek out temporary workers for short term projects.
