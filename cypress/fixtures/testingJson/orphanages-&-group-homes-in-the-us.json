Counseling services in boot camps for delinquent youths will differ from services for group homes for disabled adults or services for children in group foster care. The industry-wide need for services is related to the overall economy's health, with unemployment, drug use and societal stressors playing a significant role. Revenue is countercyclical, accelerating in troubling and trying times. In the grips of the COVID-19 pandemic, group home establishments' revenue grew, aided in no small part by the majority of establishments' nonprofit structure. With generous government assistance, industry revenue has been growing at a CAGR of 0.6% over the past five years, including a drop of 1.6% in the current year, and is expected to reach $9.9 billion in 2023, with profit hitting a new 5.5% low.",
