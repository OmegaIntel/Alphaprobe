These include nurturing livestock for wholesale markets, replenishing herds and genetic refinement practices. Wholesale activity with farmers and ranchers covers a range of practices. Stocker operations primarily deal with mature livestock suitable for either slaughter or further feeding, forming a significant market for wholesalers. This type of operation also comes into play for herd replenishment post-early culls. Seedstock operations offer a more specialized approach, concentrating on breeding livestock to refine their genetic attributes. Wholesalers could deal in one or two animals at a time, depending on demand for a reproductively viable male or female. Cow-calf operations focus on the wholesaling of young cattle to farms. The farms later implement alternative feeding strategies or use these calves for herd restocking. This particular operation forms a significant part of the livestock industry, directly contributing to the overall market stability of cattle and hog wholesalers.",
