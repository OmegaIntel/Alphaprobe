As companies ask employees to return to the office post-pandemic, demand for office plant services will climb.

At the same time, profit is expected to drop to 8.1%. The industry is expected to experience continued growth over the five years to 2029 as an improving macroeconomic environment and rising corporate profit lead more businesses to better afford the discretionary services provided by the industry.",
