    "executive_summary": "The Hoist and Winch Manufacturing industry, a component of the larger Forklift and Conveyor Manufacturing industry (IBISWorld report 33392), has experienced marginal revenue decline over the five years to 2021. Industry products are used to mechanically lift or maneuver heavy loads, so product demand is largely derived from industrial markets. Factors such as strong consumer spending growth and low interest rates support industrial activity; however, the translation of these underlying factors into demand from key industrial customers is key to industry revenue performance. The volatility of oil and other metal prices in recent years has weighed on demand from industrial markets, resulting in fluctuating equipment expenditures in mining and manufacturing markets, resulting in uneven demand for industry products. Overall, revenue has fallen an annualized 0.3% to $2.1 billion over the past five years, including an increase of 9.4% in 2021 alone due to rebounding downstream demand from lows endured in 2020 during the COVID-19 (coronavirus) pandemic.",

Lower steel prices tend to negatively affect industry revenue, diminishing per-unit prices for industry products. Moreover, the decrease in steel prices is expected to occur with a lower level of volatility, which should enable industry operators to better manage prices with long-term supply contracts.
