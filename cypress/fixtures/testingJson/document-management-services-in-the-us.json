COVID-19 caused a temporary downturn in 2020 as downstream demand from businesses declined, but elevated government and healthcare spending helped offset this. Revenue then fell in 2021 as pandemic-related government funds lapsed. Since then, growth in business formation has boosted revenue. The industry is relatively resilient due to regulations requiring document management and its diverse service offerings. Revenue is projected to grow at a 2.4% CAGR from 2024-2029, reaching $8.2 billion.",
