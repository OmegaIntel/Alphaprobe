    "executive_summary": "Figures have been adjusted for inflation and are presented in 2024 currency. Private jet charter services have had a mixed five years. While the COVID-19 pandemic stifled air travel, the industry's position as providers of socially-distanced travel allowed them to avoid more severe losses. Revenue rebounded in 2021 as corporate profit surged and pent-up demand was released. Still, much of this growth was lost in 2022 as intense inflation dragged down disposable income and forced consumers to choose cheaper options for flying. Industry revenue has swelled at a CAGR of 0.5% to an estimated $28.9 billion over the five years through 2024, including an estimated rise of 0.3% in 2024 alone.",
