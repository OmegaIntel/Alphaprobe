The impact of COVID-19 severely disrupted the labor market, causing the national unemployment rate to more than double in 2020. This dragged down revenue for PEOs, but the economy's strong recovery led to a heightened need for the industry's services brought on a skyrocketing year-over-year jump in revenue in both 2021 and 2022.",

            "current_performance_point_description": "On a macro level, improvements in the labor market imply lower unemployment, a higher labor force participation rate (LFPR) and strong population growth, boosting demand for professional employer organizations (PEOs). The US economy was in the final stages of an expansion in the late 2010s following the 2008 financial crisis. As consumer spending surged, business revenue expanded, increasing hiring and boosting employment. More workers increased investment in PEOs. COVID-19 more than doubled the unemployment rate and led to the overall deterioration of the labor market in 2020, causing revenue to fall. As the economy recovered from the pandemic, hiring surged, increasing spending on PEOs and causing revenue to soar. These shifts in employment have enhanced revenue volatility during the current period."

            "current_performance_point_description": "In 2020, many companies were forced to downsize, pause or shut down operations, lowering the need for PEOs and reducing revenue. Following the initial hit of the pandemic, businesses turned to PEOs to help manage their companies. The virus made health insurance, paid leave and other benefits more important, so companies outsourced these services to PEOs."

            "current_performance_point_description": "Expansive monetary policy, massive government spending and supply chain disruptions have caused inflation to soar recently. The Federal Reserve has been increasing interest rates significantly to combat higher prices. The elevated cost of borrowing has made it significantly more expensive for households to buy homes and companies to purchase new office space, causing residential and nonresidential construction to plunge. Revenue for the construction sector has cratered. Since construction companies comprise a notable share of revenue for PEOs, their disastrous performance has negatively affected the industry. Higher interest rates have also made it more difficult for consumers to splurge, constraining corporate profit. Lower corporate profit has made it harder for companies to afford PEOs, constraining revenue growth."

            "current_performance_point_description": "New industry-relevant regulations at the federal and state levels have regularly been introduced. For example, a new Kentucky law passed in 2022 has changed how PEOs are licensed. Five states (California, Hawaii, Minnesota, New Jersey, and New York) alone created nearly 2,400 new pieces of legislation related to COVID-19 that have impacted the way PEOs conduct business. In general, these new rules have increased licensing and certification requirements for PEOs and their employees, respectively. It's more difficult for small establishments to comply with these regulations, so many nonemployers and small players have left the industry, increasing market share concentration."

Business investment and consumer spending will benefit from higher GDP, causing revenue and profit for many corporations to increase. Higher corporate profit will give companies more funds to spend on external services, such as those offered by professional employer organizations (PEOs). As it becomes easier for companies to use PEOs, revenue will expand."

While negative real wage growth has led to some slacking participation, companies are expected to lift wages to encourage employment. While employment growth will be positive during the outlook period, the rate of increase will be constrained by external factors. Since COVID-19, businesses have become wary of hiring lots of workers. They're concerned about future outbreaks, which will inhibit revenue and raise companies' costs dramatically if they have many employees. Political forces may also raise minimum wages. This will increase costs for businesses, so many companies will hire at a slow pace to ensure they can afford a big jump in the minimum wage. Overall, relatively slow employment growth will cause revenue to rise at a meager pace."
