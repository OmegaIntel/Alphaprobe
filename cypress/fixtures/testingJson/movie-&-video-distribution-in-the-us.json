    "executive_summary": "The movie and video distribution industry primarily circulates audiovisual works to cinemas, TV networks, other exhibitors and stores. As movie theaters around the globe went dark in 2020, studios delayed blockbuster releases or pivoted to online platforms, fundamentally altering distribution dynamics. Although theaters have reopened, the industry is still playing catch-up to pre-pandemic revenue levels, with audiences increasingly favoring the convenience and affordability of streaming services. The industry continues encountering increasing external competition as digital technology enables production studios to distribute their own content and bypass dedicated distributors. The industry has increased its reliance on independent productions and existing content libraries.",

The movie and video distribution industry inched forward at a CAGR of 0.5% to $2.2 billion over the past five years, including an expected 1.2% incline in 2024.
