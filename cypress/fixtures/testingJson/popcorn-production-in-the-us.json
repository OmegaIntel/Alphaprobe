    "executive_summary": "Figures have been adjusted for inflation and are presented in 2023 currency.\n\nPopcorn production facilities produce popcorn to be sold in multiple presentations. The United States is the top producer and consumer of popcorn worldwide, partly because of the growing demand for ready-to-eat popcorn. Popcorn sales have benefited from increasing per capita disposable income. However, increasingly health-conscious consumers have become wary of high-calorie and high-sodium popcorn products and of the effects microwaves have on food. The ability to adapt to changing consumer preferences by introducing healthier product lines has enabled producers to boost sales. The 2020 pandemic and resulting stay-at-home orders caused demand for snacks to rise, resulting in the largest jump in revenue growth of the decade. Rising disposable income also boosted demand for premium products, such as gourmet and organic popcorn, supporting revenue. These trends have enabled revenue to grow at an estimated CAGR of 0.6% to $2.5 billion over the five years to 2023, including a 0.2% drop in 2023 alone.\n\nThe rising price of corn over recent years also impacts popcorn prices, which partly determine revenue. Rising demand for ethanol and unfavorable weather conditions led to a jump in corn prices. Large producers with a well-established customer base can efficiently pass down cost increases to consumers, resulting in higher revenue, while smaller producers are often forced to absorb these costs, hindering profit.\n\nProducers adapting to growing health-conscious trends by developing healthier products will be able to grow their customer base. This shows that as the industry and consumer preferences evolve, producers that are able to adapt to these changes will benefit from higher returns.\n\nOver the coming years, popcorn revenue is likely to slow down - mainly driven by falling corn prices. Producers adjust popcorn prices according to the price of corn, so drastic drops in corn prices can lead to weakening revenue. However, rising disposable income and consumers spending more time on leisure activities will protect producers from significant losses. Producers will continue focusing on new product development to adapt to changing consumer preferences, creating new opportunities in the industry. These trends will cause revenue to inch upward at an estimated CAGR of 0.1% to $2.5 billion over the five years to 2028.",

Snacks are often considered discretionary products - when disposable income rises, consumers are inclined to purchase more snacks, boosting demand for popcorn. Similarly, when consumers spend less time in leisure activities, demand for popcorn products weakens, as popcorn is commonly consumed while watching movies, sporting events and gatherings. High inflation over recent years has caused popcorn sales to slow down as consumers lower discretionary spending."

This trend has pushed producers to adjust their product mixes to adapt to shifting health trends by introducing and marketing products with lower sodium and fat content. Smaller companies have benefited even more by focusing specifically on healthier, ready-to-eat popcorn products."
