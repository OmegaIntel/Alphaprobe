While hand tools are practical, projects often have strict deadlines, which are easier to meet when using power tools. Unlike hand tools, power tools often need to be replaced, increasing demand. Residential and nonresidential construction represent two critical markets for manufacturers. Amid the pandemic, residential construction was bolstered because of the low housing stock and low-interest rates. This growth has tapered off after an economic recovery and a rise in interest rates."

Purchasing power tools for home improvements is more cost-effective than hiring a professional. The pandemic also spurred consumers to take on various do-it-yourself projects.

Import penetration remains challenging as low-wage countries produce power tools quickly and at much lower costs. Imported power tools make up more than 70.0% of domestic demand, as a strong US dollar makes it easier to purchase foreign goods. Even so, many buyers still prefer domestic power tools and will pay a higher price for brand loyalty and quality."
