    "executive_summary": "The Paving Contractors industry has recently benefited from broad economic improvements, including rising per capita disposable income and relatively low unemployment. Due to the pandemic, nonresidential construction activity was disrupted amid health restrictions. Simultaneously residential construction flourished as homeowners took advantage of time for home improvement. This dynamic has partially reversed as high interest rates have dissuaded residential construction investment, while nonresidential construction has experienced a resurgence. Industry revenue fell at a CAGR 1.0% to $23.1 billion in 2023, with profit reaching 6.8%.",
