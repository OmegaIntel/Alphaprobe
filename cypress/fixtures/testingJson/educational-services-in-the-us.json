    "executive_summary": "The Educational Services sector comprises 13 subsectors of the US economy, ranging from public schools to testing and educational support schools. Primary, secondary and postsecondary schools alone generate 94.0% of the sector's revenue. Most of these institutions rely entirely on government funding, and nearly three-quarters of the educational services revenue comes from public schools and public universities. Accordingly, strong federal, state and local support for all levels of education has driven revenue upward over the past five years. Rising per capita disposable income has made private schools and higher education more affordable for students and parents, though recent inflation has strained consumers' wallets. Solid government funding for education has helped support the sector's success even amid fluctuating enrollment. Faltering birth rates are leading to lower head counts in K-12 schools, and ballooning student debt has made many would-be college students skeptical of the return on investment of an expensive degree. Federal plans to address student debt have been up in the air, but the rollout Department of Education's newest income-driven repayment program will likely make postsecondary education more attractive to a broader base of consumers. Trends in the domestic economy are set to move in the sector's favor over the next five years as prospective students become more able to afford rising tuition rates. A rise in unemployment will intensify competition for available jobs, encouraging consumers to continue their education and improve their resumes.",
