    "executive_summary": "The portable toilet rental and septic tank cleaning industry has performed well during the current period, with revenue volatility. Demand from entertainment events was strong as disposable incomes grew, but was severely hindered by COVID-19 social distancing in 2020. However, record-low interest rates fueled construction activity, offering a valuable revenue stream. Revenue soared in 2021 as pandemic restrictions ended. Spending on outdoor activities remained strong, preventing revenue declines in 2022-2023 despite rising interest rates reducing construction. However, high inflation hindered profit. Overall industry revenue is anticipated to surge at a 3.4% CAGR during the current period, reaching $9.9 billion in 2024.",
