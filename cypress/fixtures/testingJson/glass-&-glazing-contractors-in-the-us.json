The COVID-19 pandemic significantly halted activity within the nonresidential building market and forced businesses to revise construction plans amid the plummeting economy. Establishments and operations were forced to close to curtail the spread of the virus. This resulted in historical levels of unemployment, a decrease in consumer spending and a general decline in overall economic activity. Nonresidential construction activity will continue declining in 2023 as work in this sector takes longer to improve post-recession."

To stimulate the stagnant economy, the Federal Reserve lowered interest rates to curtail the negative effects of the COVID-19-induced recession. Mortgage rates followed suit and were lowered as well. This greatly benefited the industry's secondary market, residential construction, since home building and renovation projects take a relatively short amount of time to complete and are highly susceptible and responsive to the price of financing."

            "current_performance_point_description": "Institutional building construction, consisting of government-owned buildings such as schools, universities and hospitals, has modestly grown compared with other forms of nonresidential building. These structures provide significant demand for interior and exterior glass and glazing services, especially within the hospital segment due to heightened demand amid the COVID-19 pandemic. Though in conjunction with tighter budgets, suspension of in-class learning and institutional employees working from home, some local governments curbed spending on new construction."

Retail shop owners and other commercial property owners, in addition to apartment building property managers, cannot delay glass repair if a building's glass front or window is damaged, making repair services somewhat resistant to broader economic conditions."

Still, the industry will remain shielded since activity within the nonresidential construction market is a larger determinant of industry performance compared with residential construction."

The key segments of the nonresidential construction market include office and commercial space expansion, which will be lifted by restored business sentiment and hospital and educational building construction, supported by expanding government budgets. Demand for glass exteriors will increase in many of these buildings, especially in commercial centers, along with decorative glass and mirrors for the interior. Remodeling and retrofit projects in commercial buildings are also expected to provide steady work for industry contractors."

            "future_outlook_point_description": "As the economy fully recovers from the COVID-19 pandemic and work in all sectors returns to normal levels, the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates to maintain a substantial level of economic growth. Since home building and renovation projects take a relatively short amount of time to complete, the level of activity within the residential building market is highly susceptible to the price of financing. As financing becomes more expensive, people are less likely to refinance and renovate their homes. Also, since the construction of new houses is more costly than making repairs for existing buildings, the increased cost of financing will be a larger detriment to new housing starts."

Some architects and environmental advocates have raised concerns regarding the energy efficiency of conventional floor-to-ceiling glass windows and curtain walls. The high level of sun exposure makes maintaining a steady interior climate expensive, raising energy usage for the structure and increasing tenants' utility costs. To regulate energy use, building designs may moderate use of curtain walls and window areas. If building designers decide to slowly incorporate less square footage of glass, it could produce less contract sizes and slow revenue growth."

            "question": "Does your company primarily work with residential or non-residential construction markets?",
            "answer": "Contractors in the Glass and Glazing industry primarily work with residential and nonresidential construction clients and can switch between these markets, depending on the size of their operations. Maintaining a mix of business in both markets can help protect revenue and profit against downturns in any single market. However, nonresidential construction accounts for a larger share of industry demand."
        },
        {
            "question": "What percentage of your operations are solely focused on new work? Do you participate in remodeling activities?",
            "answer": "Industry operators provide glasswork services during new construction activities as well as during residential and commercial remodels. Providing services to both markets is important since demand for industry services from new construction work typically suffers during economic slowdowns while remodeling and repair word tend to fluctuate less significantly."
        },
        {
            "question": "How does your company compete for contracts with larger businesses? Do you ever find you lack the capacity to deliver on larger and more lucrative projects?",
            "answer": "Most large operators in the industry compete on the basis of quality, especially for lucrative contracts with large projects. These operators typically do not lack the capacity to deliver on more lucrative projects."
        },
        {
            "question": "What is the size of your staff? How does that compare to your competitors?",

        },
        {
            "question": "How much does your company invest in new equipment annually?",

            "question": "Have any regulatory expenses significantly impacted your company's profitability recently?",
            "answer": "Regulatory expenses have not significantly impacted company profitability, but industry participants are required to hold licenses to carry out business within each state and territory, which can slightly increase costs."

        {
            "question": "How does your company's profit compare to that of your closest competitor?",
            "answer": "Profitability varies depending on the price of inputs and construction demand. Smaller operators tend to have lower profit, while larger contractors that accept more lucrative contracts typically experience wider margin."

            "question": "Does your company have a recognizable brand? How much does your company spend on advertising?",

            "question": "How do you plan to mitigate the threat of rising interest rates for home purchasers? How much of your business is residential?",

            "question": "Is your company able to improve sales along with increases in consumer spending? What measures will you take to promote industry services?",
            "answer": "Expenditure on renovations increases with disposable income. Conversely, it falls with low disposable income, as households resort to do-it-yourself repairs and alterations instead of hiring a contractor."
        },
        {
            "question": "How would a decline in corporate profit affect demand for your company? How do you mitigate this threat?",
            "answer": "Corporate profit for downstream businesses affects industry demand, as companies with higher profit are more enabled to purchase, upgrade and repair glass structures, such as windows and glass doors."
