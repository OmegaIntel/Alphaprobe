Consumers with higher disposable income are more likely to purchase discretionary personal training services. Revenue is expected to grow at 3.3% CAGR to $12.9 billion through 2024 when profit reaches 12.8%. The industry continued growing during the pandemic by adapting to online workouts. Rising inflation and interest rates in 2024 caused a 0.8% revenue drop as consumers cut discretionary spending. Over the next five years to 2029, economic conditions are expected to improve, boosting demand for discretionary purchases like personal trainers.",
