    "executive_summary": "Fire protection and security system installation contractors have struggled through the current period as companies cope with economic uncertainty, high interest rates and poor business and consumer sentiment. Companies have faced severe volatility, especially during the pandemic. Business closures and reduced corporate profit led to subdued demand for fire protection and security systems from nonresidential markets. Even so, roaring housing starts and elevated private spending on home improvement supported residential markets and prevented greater exposure to the pandemic downturn.",

Nonresidential construction markets plummeted amid lockdown restrictions and business closures. Most companies pushed off new construction projects, limiting demand for security and fire protection systems. This trend forced many companies, especially nonemployers, to exit the industry altogether."

Mortgage and borrowing rates have trampled homeowner sentiment, slashing housing starts and leading to notable revenue drops. Similarly, many businesses have remained hesitant to start new construction projects due to high borrowing costs. Even so, office vacancy rates have declined as employees return to work. In particular, pent-up demand for travel has led to booming demand for new security systems from the accommodation sector."

In particular, new construction activity will rebound, creating notable opportunities for contractors since most states legally require smoke detectors in new projects. Similarly, corporate profit will soar through the outlook period, encouraging greater business activity and expansion. Many companies will open up new offices and facilities, necessitating smoke detectors and security systems. This trend will be especially important given the nonresidential market's revenue share."
