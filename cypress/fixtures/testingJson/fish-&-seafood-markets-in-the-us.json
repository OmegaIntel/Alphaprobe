    "executive_summary": "Figures have been adjusted for inflation and are presented in 2024 currency. Fish and seafood markets comprise establishments that retail primarily fresh, frozen and cured fish and seafood items, including the online sales of fish products or fish. Seafood counters that operate within a supermarket aren't included. Expanding per capita seafood consumption and rising per capita disposable income have also benefited companies in the fish and seafood market. Also, the growing incidence of heart disease and obesity in the United States has encouraged consumers to incorporate finfish and fish oil into their diets. Coupled with a renewed interest in locally sourced food, health and nutrition trends emphasizing the importance of eating seafood have driven growth. However, boosting external competition with larger supercenter retailers has made it difficult for fish and seafood markets to compete on pricing. Industry-wide revenue has been growing at an average annualized 2.7% over the past five years and is expected to total $4.3 billion in 2024, when revenue will rise by an estimated 0.8%. Interest in the health benefits of seafood consumption has driven demand for fish and seafood products; however, pricing and consumer trends have also impacted fish and seafood market revenue and profit. Although per capita seafood consumption has dipped, the seafood prices have swelled. As the economy recovers, strengthening disposable income levels will keep demand steady despite higher prices.",

            "current_performance_point_description": "COVID-19 made buying feed much more expensive, driving up fish prices, which led fish and seafood markets to pass on boosted costs to downstream industries and consumers. Although the pandemic drove up seafood prices and led many consumers to avoid shopping for groceries in person, some consumers made fish and seafood purchases online, which helped support revenue. As disposable income strengthens alongside per capita seafood consumption and the price of seafood, domestic consumers shift away from lower-priced canned or frozen seafood in favor of more expensive and higher-margin steaks and filets of fish and seafood."

Various organizations, including the American Heart Association, have recommended that adults boost their intake of foods that are relatively high in omega-3 fatty acids to prevent and manage heart disease, expanding the popularity of seafood with high omega-3 content, including salmon, oysters, trout and tuna. Serious outbreaks of foodborne illnesses like E. coli, salmonella and listeria have helped encourage consumers to purchase local produce, including meat and seafood, steering them toward more locally sourced, fresher products."

The heightened publicity regarding the mercury content of certain fish and seafood items has discouraged some consumers from purchasing fish and seafood. High levels of mercury in humans are linked to negative health conditions including neurological and chromosomal problems, in addition to birth defects.
