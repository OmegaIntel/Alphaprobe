    "executive_summary": "Figures have been adjusted for inflation and are presented in 2024 currency.\n\nPilates and yoga studios have evolved significantly, driven by digital innovation and shifting consumer preferences. Despite strengthening participation in yoga and Pilates, the emergence of lower-cost alternatives has stifled studio attendance. Online platforms, mobile applications, gyms and fitness centers have intensified competition for studios. The availability of high-quality online resources has ushered in an era where enthusiasts can easily practice from the comfort of their homes. Revenue has fallen at a CAGR of 1.7% to reach an estimated $14.7 billion leading up to 2024, when revenue will dip an expected 6.8%.\n\nWhile Pilates participation rates have remained somewhat stagnant in recent years, yoga participation rates have boomed. Still, this expansion in practitioners hasn't translated to Pilates and yoga studio sales since yoga is more accessible for newcomers to pick up and maintain outside of a studio. Pilates practitioners may be more inclined to attend classes to have access to high-cost equipment like reformers and towers. To keep yoga practitioners coming back, studios have expansively appealed to niche demographics through prenatal, senior or power yoga classes.",
