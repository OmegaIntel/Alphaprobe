In 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic negatively influenced downstream manufacturer demand. Following the pandemic, even with the economy showing signs of recovery, the Russian invasion of Ukraine and the higher interest rate environment due to inflation-fighting have hurt manufacturing activity, supply chains and limited consumer spending growth. As a result, industry revenue has decreased at a CAGR of 0.6% to $37.8 billion over the past five years, including a projected 1.5% decline in 2024.",

Energy is one of the industry's direct production costs, which has been increasing over the past five years. Manufacturers compete on the cost to maintain profitability because all producers manufacture the same basket of products.
