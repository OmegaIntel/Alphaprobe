    "executive_summary": "Figures have been adjusted for inflation and are presented in 2024 currency.\n\nFluctuations in commodity prices have led to substantial revenue swings within the industry. Highly susceptible to the prices of aluminum and steel, the industry saw significant growth between 2021 and 2022 due to price surges post-pandemic, driven by supply chain disruptions including lockdowns, port closures and labor shortages. However, as global supply chains and economies began to normalize, a decline in aluminum and steel prices in 2023 resulted in a downturn for the industry, with expectations of continued downward pressure on growth in 2024. Overall, industry revenue is estimated to grow at a CAGR of 2.3%, including projected 0.5% growth in 2024 alone, reaching $26.0 billion.\n\nDespite the price swings, demand for metal cans has been supported by growth in the beverage manufacturing industry, particularly among soft drink and beer producers. Population growth has propelled higher beverage consumption, though shifting consumer preferences towards wine and spirits have exerted downward pressures on demand for metal cans. Despite these shifts, beer remains a significant driver of industry demand. Additionally, the cost structure has been impacted by tariffs on imported aluminum and steel from China, temporarily hampering profitability following the onset of trade tensions in 2018. Nevertheless, the industry has advanced in recycling and coating technologies, embracing closed-loop recycling systems, eco-friendly coatings and innovations to improve efficiency and environmental impact.",

Following the pandemic, aluminum and steel prices experienced a significant surge, which contributed to the overall growth of the industry between 2021 and 2022. The pandemic caused disruptions in global supply chains. Lockdowns, port closures and labor shortages hampered the production and transportation of raw materials and finished goods, leading to reduced supply. Lower supply led to strong price increases. However, as supply chains and global economies began to normalize, steel and aluminum prices declined in 2023, contributing to the industry's downturn that year. In 2024, commodity prices are expected to continue exerting downward pressure on industry growth."

The beverage manufacturing industry experienced growth during the current period, benefiting metal can manufacturers. Demand for alcoholic and soft beverages is generally driven by population growth and consumer preferences. Continued population growth has contributed to higher beverage consumption, leading to increased demand for a variety of beverage options. However, consumer preferences for alcoholic drinks overall have been shifting toward wine and spirits, moving away from beer. This shift has suppressed growth in demand for metal cans. Despite this trend, beer still accounts for the vast majority of all alcoholic drinks consumed in the US, providing a stable source of demand for metal can manufacturers."

A substantial portion of steel and aluminum is imported from China, which is the largest producer of steel and aluminum globally. The trade war between the US and China, which started in 2018, resulted in a substantial increase in tariffs on both US goods exported to China and Chinese goods imported to the US, including aluminum and steel. As a result, the industry's profitability suffered in the first few years following the beginning of the trade war."

Companies had developed closed-loop recycling systems to ensure that aluminum and steel cans were continuously repurposed into new cans with minimal material loss. Efforts to decarbonize recycling processes had been underway, with innovations such as renewable energy integration and carbon capture technologies. Furthermore, chemical recycling methods have emerged, breaking down coatings and polymers more efficiently. Public-private partnerships had been established to bolster recycling infrastructure and educate the public, leading to higher recycling rates. Simultaneously, the industry had made notable strides in advanced coatings. Manufacturers had shifted towards BPA-free linings like polyester or acrylic-based alternatives, addressing health concerns while maintaining necessary barrier properties."

Growth in aluminum prices will be partly offset by increased supply, as European smelters restart operations after halting due to the energy price shock from the war in Ukraine. Power pricing significantly affects aluminum production costs, helping to balance rising demand."

China's domestic demand for steel and iron is expected to remain weak, supporting lower projected global prices for iron and steel in the coming years. In addition to subdued demand from China, the anticipated increase in iron ore production in Australia and Brazil, along with new projects elsewhere, will likely put further downward pressure on steel prices, decelerating growth in industry revenue."
