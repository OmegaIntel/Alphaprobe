    "executive_summary": "The Abrasive and Sandpaper Manufacturing industry produces a diverse range of abrasive products used in various applications across the manufacturing, automotive, aerospace, telecommunications, construction, cleaning and maintenance markets. While demand from these markets grew, this growth has been negated by increased import competition, plummeting commodity prices and a slowing manufacturing sector. Also, in 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic contributed to falling demand from construction and industrial markets, as lockdowns and supply chain disruptions made industrial production difficult. However, as the pandemic passes and the economy begins to recover, pent-up demand for construction and manufacturing will surge in demand for industry products.",

Automotive manufacturers and the auto aftermarket, which provide vehicle repair and part replacement, are both major downstream markets for the industry that face a downfall during the pandemic. Rising construction has also helped boost abrasive demand, especially in the housing sector, which uses abrasives extensively. Demand for abrasive products has also been aided by increased shipments from fabricated metals, durable goods and consumer manufacturers, including the electrical equipment and appliances sector."

            "current_performance_point_description": "International trade is essential because of the universal need for industry products. The trade-weighted index, which measures the strength of the US dollar relative to its trading partners' currencies, has climbed. Fewer regulations and reduced wage costs also assist abrasive goods produced abroad. As a result, foreign-produced abrasives have been relatively less expensive for domestic downstream markets. This trend has limited potential revenue gains for companies."

As a result of this stable competitive environment and increased acquisition activity, the number of businesses has declined. Because of improving technology and companies attempting to combat declining profit, industry employment has grown. Industry consolidation, cost-cutting measures and the gradual adoption of labor-saving technologies have helped place downward pressure on employment."

Demand for abrasives in the building and construction market will face solid growth stemming from increased demand in the housing market and stable demand from heavy construction markets. Aggregate private investment, which includes spending by individuals and businesses on physical structures, equipment and software, will also grow. Improved production across the manufacturing sector will support demand for abrasive products. However, demand conditions will vary across key downstream markets."

A depreciating US dollar will bolster this trend compared with other currencies. Although, heightened overseas competition will limit opportunities abroad. Industry employment expands as more workers are required to satisfy enhanced demand from domestic and foreign downstream markets. Even with increased demand, high competition and relatively low average profit deter companies from entering the industry."

Multinational companies, like the 3M Company and Compagnie de Saint-Gobain SA, will continue to dominate the industry, as these companies benefit from both economies of scope and scale. Through large-scale procurement contracts, these companies can lower per-unit purchasing costs for inputs and operate more efficiently than their competitors. The continued penetration of less expensive imports into the US market will limit price flexibility among the major US manufacturers."
