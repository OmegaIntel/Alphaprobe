    "executive_summary": "Pizza restaurants have suffered revenue declines due to growing competition and some economic volatility over the past five years. Still, demand for pizza restaurants, specifically, has persisted, despite and somewhat because of the pandemic. Pizza is a mainstay in many American households, but other restaurants have begun selling it and various at-home options exist (frozen pizza). Further, rising health consciousness among Americans have lowered demand for pizzas. Overall, pizza restaurant revenue has been falling at a CAGR of 2.4% over the past five years and is expected to reach $50.1 billion in 2024 when revenue will increase an estimated 1.4%.",
