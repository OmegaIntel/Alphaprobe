Electric submersible pumps (ESPs) are a type of downhole device used on drilling rigs to provide artificial lift for subterranean liquids. According to industry leader Schlumberger Ltd., only an estimated 5.0% of the world's nearly 1.0 million oil- and gas-producing wells flow naturally, so much of the world's oil and gas production relies on artificial lift equipment such as ESPs. Therefore, changes in price and production volumes of oil and gas affect demand for ESPs.",
