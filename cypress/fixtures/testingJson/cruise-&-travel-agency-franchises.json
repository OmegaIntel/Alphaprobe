    "executive_summary": "Overall, the Cruise and Travel Agency Franchises industry has experienced significant growth over the five years to 2022. Despite the COVID-19 (coronavirus) pandemic, strong performance throughout most of the current period contributed to growth in demand for cruises and travel as a whole. Cruise ships remained largely in port during 2020 due to a \"no sail\" order and travel was extremely limited. As a result, industry revenue is estimated to grow an annualized 13.8% to $5.1 billion over the past five years. Moreover, pent-up demand for travel, rising per capita disposable income and a return to the water for cruise ships began to assist the industry in 2021 and is expected to continue doing so in 2022 and beyond.",
