A major drought across the continental US severely cut crop yields in 2020 and 2021, pushing feed costs to historic highs, which forced feed manufacturers to up prices to preserve profitability. Imports skyrocketed in 2021 to supplement domestic production but have remained minuscule as a share of domestic demand. Overall meat consumption has continued to expand, despite slumps in beef consumption. Thanks to the industry's ability to pass on most heightened input costs to downstream industries, industry-wide revenue has been growing at a CAGR of 2.9% over the past five years and is expected to total $46.4 billion in 2023, when revenue will sink by an estimated 2.3%.",

Feed from a variety of countries flooded into the US market and undercut US feed suppliers, though long-term contracts and fast delivery times helped domestic producers remain the primary suppliers of domestic demand. Import penetration rose in 2021 but has begun to slump. Even still, imports have consistently accounted for less than 3.0% of domestic demand."

McKinsey & Company estimates that 30.0% of China's population will be in or above the upper-middle income range by 2030, a sharp rise from its current 20.0%.
