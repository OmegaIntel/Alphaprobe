Consumers have been increasingly adopting electric vehicles amid prominent pushes to use products that are sustainable and more environmentally friendly than traditionally fuel-operated vehicles. The growing popularity of electric vehicles has led consumers to require charging stations across the country, particularly for consumers who have to go on longer drives or road trips. As a result, major charging station companies expanded their network, further driving revenue growth.",
