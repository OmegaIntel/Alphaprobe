    "executive_summary": "The Engraving Services industry has experienced volatility, primarily driven by mixed operating conditions. Rising per capita disposable income has helped to support revenue growth. However, the economic slowdown following the spread of COVID-19 caused a sizable decline in industry revenue. With unemployment rising during 2020, consumers and companies became less likely to spend for the industry's discretionary services to customize products. Despite the turbulence, many companies have expanded their online presence, which has sustained demand and contributed to the industry's recovery. As the economy has rebounded, improved corporate profit and consumer confidence levels have helped to boost industry revenue.",
