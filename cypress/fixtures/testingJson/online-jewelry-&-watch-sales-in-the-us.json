    "executive_summary": "Figures have been adjusted for inflation and are presented in 2024 currency.\n\nOnline jewelry and watch sales have grown, with the popularity of online shopping driving the industry's strong revenue performance. Demand for jewelry and watches has increased as consumers with higher rates of disposable income have increasingly purchased higher-priced discretionary goods. Despite the economic disruptions brought on by the pandemic, online jewelry and watch sales continued to grow as the popularity of online shopping skyrocketed and consumers with higher incomes continued to make luxury purchases. Overall, revenue is set to grow at an estimated CAGR of 9.2% to $14.3 billion through 2024, including an increase of 0.1% drop that year alone.",

High-earning consumers, those making more than $100,000 a year, generate the largest share of revenue, accounting for more than 60.0% of sales. Because of this, retailers have experienced revenue growth in recent years despite unfavorable macroeconomic conditions."

The price of precious metals and stones, including gold, silver and diamonds, influence upstream manufacturers' production costs and, therefore, jewelry selling prices. Because retailers largely target consumers with higher disposable income, drastic jewelry price increases amid jumping input prices have heavily contributed to rapid revenue gains, particularly as consumer preferences switched toward online shopping."

These sellers have significantly lower start-up costs and typically lower rent and utility costs, as they don't operate out of a physical retail location but can operate from their warehouse. Online retailers also have better access to real-time data, which enables them to better price their products and manage inventory."
