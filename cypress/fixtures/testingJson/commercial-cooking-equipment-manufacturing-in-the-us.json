    "executive_summary": "The Commercial Cooking Equipment Manufacturing industry has grown, despite volatility in recent years. Through 2019, rising consumer spending, spurred by greater per capita disposable income and increased aggregate private investment, supported downstream demand. As consumers spent more on dining experiences, restaurants and other food-service companies invested in commercial cooking equipment to fulfill demand and adapt to the evolution of the restaurant industry. However, the COVID-19 pandemic injected volatility into the industry, as downstream demand dissipated in 2020 amidst widespread shutdown to stem the spread of the pandemic. Consumers have since returned to restaurants as the pandemic has abated,",

In particular, food-service establishments were forced to entirely close or switch to all takeout operations, which led to an uptick in sector bankruptcies. Frequently, closing food-service manufacturers sell the used commercial equipment to other sector manufacturers."

Since 2021, rising per capita disposable income, increased aggregate private investment and rising demand from food services and drinking places has bolstered demand for commercial cooking equipment."

The food-service sector will grow modestly, and consumers will continue to allocate a sizeable chunk of their paychecks to dining out as concerns about the pandemic abate. Sustained growth in consumer spending levels will likely prompt downstream restaurant and hospitality industries to modestly increase investment in commercial cooking equipment."

        {
            "question": "How is your company affected by rising imports?",
            "answer": "Rising imports compete with our products on a cost basis due to their low wage costs. A sizable percentage of commercial cooking equipment is produced internationally, making it a very competitive atmosphere."
        },
        {
            "question": "Does your company specialize in a niche or do you produce a diversified range of products?",
            "answer": "We produce a diversified range of products including commercial cooking equipment; commercial food preparation machines; and other commercial containers requiring a high degree of cleanliness and sanitization."
        },
        {
            "question": "Has your company been exposed to volatile input prices over the past few years?",
            "answer": "The price of steel is subject to some volatility, often rising and falling in line with overall economic activity. Due to the high level of price volatility, it is difficult to price products in the long term."
        },
        {
            "question": "Have you looked into setting up manufacturing facilities in lower-wage regions of the country?",
            "answer": "Outsourcing manufacturing to low-cost regions greatly reduces wage costs. Consequently, companies have turned to low-wage labor to remain competitive in terms of price."
        },
        {
            "question": "How is your company leveraging new technology, such as RFID tags?",
            "answer": "Automation has greatly enhanced manufacturing capacity and standardization of products. Specialized production components help to specialize our equipment for specific applications."

            "question": "Have you been able to reduce wage costs through automation over the past five years?",
            "answer": "Automation has helped to curb wage costs for most of employees. However, companies hire highly specialized employees for products, who do require high levels of compensation."
        },
        {
            "question": "How does your company stay ahead of regulations, such as energy-efficiency standards?",

        },
        {
            "question": "How does input price volatility affect profit margins?",
            "answer": "High volatility, coupled with high input prices negatively impacts profit margins. Consequently, due to the high price of inputs and the prevalence of low-cost imports, profit margins are negatively impacted by volatility."
        },
        {
            "question": "What percentage of your customers renew their contracts?",
            "answer": "Due to product and regional specialization, many customers stick with one brand. Custom-made products become a necessity for customers, and they subsequently depend on them for their reliability and familiarity with the brand."
        },
        {
            "question": "How automated are your production facilities? What capital upgrades do you have planned in the near future?",
            "answer": "Automation reduces costs, particularly those associated with labor. US manufacturers experience relatively high labor costs compared with overseas manufacturers in less-developed countries. Automation can replace costly labor requirements with capital and equipment."
