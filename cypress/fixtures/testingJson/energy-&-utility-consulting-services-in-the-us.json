Energy and utility consulting services have thrived throughout the period, as fluctuations among mining and energy extraction companies caused them to seek the aid of consultants. The pandemic caused an uptick in revenue as businesses tried to find ways to adjust their operations amid turmoil. As the effects of the pandemic waned, energy and metal prices soared, which made consultants even more critical. This uptick in prices led to surges in corporate profit, allowing businesses to pay extra and bolstering revenue. Overall revenue is estimated to swell at a CAGR of 6.6% to reach $7.3 billion through 2024, including a 0.6% dip in 2024 alone as the rapid growth comes to a halt. Profit is also set to remain elevated.",

        {
            "question": "How does your company ensure exposure to end markets?",
