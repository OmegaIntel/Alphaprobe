            "answer": "Rural communities are experiencing a decline in accessibility to fertility services, as most industry organizations are located in urban areas. Merger and acquisition activity is common in the industry since larger operators often experience cost benefits of economies of scale. Merger and acquisition activity is often used to penetrate previously untapped geographic markets."

        },
        {
            "question": "Is your company dominant in any particular regional markets? What range does your company have in terms of viable operating area?",
            "answer": "Patients of fertility clinics typically prefer to access facilities close to their homes. This is particularly true when multiple visits are necessary. Locating in areas with high concentrations of young couples may prove more beneficial than a generally populous area."
        },
        {
            "question": "How have you been affected by government policies? How has your company adapted to health and safety guidelines related to the COVID-19 (coronavirus) pandemic?",

            "question": "Private Health Coverage",
            "answer": "A variety of private health insurance plans cover infertility treatments.
