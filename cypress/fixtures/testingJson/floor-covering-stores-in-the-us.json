    "executive_summary": "Floor covering stores derives their demand from two massive downstream markets. Residential and nonresidential markets play a pivotal role in the growth of floor covering stores. Over the past five years, the COVID-19 pandemic hit the nonresidential market hard, as businesses were forced to close, and employees had to work from home whenever possible. This slowdown in business activity depressed any further growth seen by the industry. At the same time, more consumers remaining at home caused a jump in spending on home improvements and housing starts. Thus, the strong demand stemming from the residential market drove revenue growth through 2020.",

            "current_performance_point_description": "Over the past five years, the residential sector has experienced rapid demand, stemming from historically low interest rates throughout most of the five years. Even through 2020, as COVID-19 swept through the United States, demand for flooring remained heightened. High per capita disposable income met with increased investment into home improvement bolstered demand for flooring as well."

            "current_performance_point_description": "Beginning in 2020, as COVID-19 disruptions took their place, the US government forced most businesses to close, and most workers were required to work from home if possible. As a result, activity in the nonresidential markets plummeted since companies went fully online, and no businesses were looking to expand."

            "current_performance_point_title": "The Growing Presence of Big-Box Stores Limited Growth",
            "current_performance_point_description": "Because floor covering stores operate within the larger home improvement market, retailers are in direct competition with nationwide stores like Lowe's and the Home Depot. These stores have a considerably larger presence than floor covering stores, making it difficult for operators to fully capitalize on the bolstered growth from the residential market, limiting revenue growth as a result."

With interest rates anticipated to remain high, activity in residential and nonresidential markets will slow to a crawl. With interest rates growing, financing a mortgage, borrowing money and building a new office all become more costly to the consumer or business."

In addition to the large selection and presence of these stores, they also offer a fleet of experts who can install new flooring."

Many of the negative macroeconomic trends plaguing the consumer in the period are expected to diminish. As a result, per capita disposable income is expected to grow. Although interest rates are set to crush downstream demand for most floor covering products, this jump in disposable income may push consumers to upgrade their current floor coverings for something of higher quality."
