However, as production ramped up in 2022 to take advantage of favorable pricing from Russia's invasion of Ukraine, providers enjoyed strong growth but did not recover from pandemic declines. Revenue has fallen at a 5.0% CAGR to $95.4 billion in 2023 with a 4.2% decrease, while profit is set to climb to 20.4%. The adoption of efficient enhanced oil recovery techniques initially benefitted providers but has decreased rig demand.",
