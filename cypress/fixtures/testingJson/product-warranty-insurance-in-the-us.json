    "executive_summary": "The Product Warranty Insurance industry underwrites factory warranties for manufacturers and extended warranties for retailers and consumers. Product warranties insure major electronics, household appliances and other products against defects or damage and cover repair and replacement costs. Product warranty insurance providers have benefited from a jump in electronics prices, which has led to greater prices of premiums to insure these goods. Also, strong economic growth at the outset of the current period and the federal response to COVID-19 have benefited the industry, resulting in greater disposable income and a expanding housing market. These developments have resulted in more product purchases, ultimately generating new demand for product warranty insurance. Over the past five years, revenue has grown at a CAGR of 3.4% to $1.9 billion, including an expected decline of 0.2% in 2023. Profit is expected to climb to 15.3% of revenue in 2023, up from 14.5% in 2018.",

In addition, disposable income increased, resulting in more product purchases and a stronger housing market. The federal government passed substantial legislation to support the economy in response to COVID-19. This provided direct stimulus payments and tax breaks, driving per capita disposable income and product purchases, increasing purchases of product warranty insurance."

SquareTrade Inc. (SquareTrade) is an internet-based product warranty company, offering consumers various protection plans primarily for consumer electronics, appliances and home entertainment equipment.

Typically, this industry is more labor-intensive, relying on the skills of underwriters and other insurance professionals to help sell, underwrite and process product warranty policies. However, most capital expenses have come in the form of technology upgrades, as capital is needed for information technology as systems are used to track policies, payments and claims. Systems are also used by actuaries to model insurance risk, ensuring insurance providers have proper reserves in case of a catastrophic event. Companies have continued to improve their technology to provide better customer service, like efficient customer responses and user-friendly websites."

Software has recently been developed to automate a part of the claims process associated with warranties. This has provided some downstream consumers to provide their clients with warranties directly instead of through insurance providers. However, rectifying a claim still requires human input to identify specific issues associated with products. Despite the introduction of new technologies, users have still preferred to outsource the entire product warranty process to insurance providers, insulating it from experiencing disruptions in demand."

Warranty underwriters rely on computer technology and storage to maintain customer records, process financial transactions and handle claims. Unlike other insurance industries, product warranty policies are comparatively straightforward, and consumers typically do not require the advice of an insurance professional to understand a policy. This characteristic is also the result of regulation that requires warranty language to be clear and easily understandable. With these conventions in place, the rising accessibility of internet-based services has led to substantial shifts in industry structure. Disruptive companies like SquareTrade Inc., which offers after-purchase warranties for electronics and appliances directly to consumers, are directing the industry away from retailers that traditionally handled most warranty transactions. This trend is expected to continue over the coming years as broadband internet access becomes faster, less expensive and more widely available."
