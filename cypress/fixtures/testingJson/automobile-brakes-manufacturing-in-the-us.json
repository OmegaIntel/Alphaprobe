    "executive_summary": "The automobile brakes manufacturing industry in the US has faced significant challenges in the current period from 2019 to 2024, with revenue declining at an estimated compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 3.4% to reach $10.8 billion in 2024. Supply chain disruptions, economic volatility, and rising interest rates have dampened growth opportunities despite strong performance in commercial vehicle markets. However, the industry is expected to rebound during the outlook period from 2024 to 2029, with revenue projected to grow at a CAGR of 1.7% to $11.7 billion by 2029.",

            "current_performance_point_description": "Automobile brake manufacturers have endured severe supply chain uncertainty following the pandemic and the Russian invasion of Ukraine. In particular, skyrocketing crude oil prices contributed to elevated ferrous and nonferrous metal purchasing costs. As a result, many companies suffered from elevated purchasing costs and diminished profit. Larger companies were able to leverage globalized supply chains and extensive supplier networks to mitigate costs. Similarly, these industry leaders were largely able to pass added costs onto buyers because of strong reputations, extensive networks and stable purchasing contracts with motor vehicle manufacturers. Smaller companies were largely forced to absorb costs, leading to reduced profit. Supply chain disruptions also influenced consumer behavior; higher gas prices discouraged driving activity, leading to less wear and tear on brakes and fewer repairs."

            "current_performance_point_description": "The automotive supply chain has faced severe economic volatility through the current period. In particular, the pandemic created unprecedented, lingering economic disruptions. As a result, consumer confidence and spending plummeted, limiting demand for travel and new cars. Even as the government issued stimulus checks and lifted lockdown restrictions, automobile brake markets have remained downtrodden. Pent-up demand for travel provided a minor reprieve in 2022, but surging inflation and rising interest rates cut into strong downstream performance. Specifically, high rates made securing auto loans and investing in new vehicles expensive for most consumers and businesses. Drivers have shown greater willingness to repair older vehicles rather than purchase a new one; despite generating a small amount of revenue from aftermarkets, brake manufacturers have been unable to recoup losses in a weak market."

            "current_performance_point_title": "Strong shipping activity prevents more severe declines",
            "current_performance_point_description": "Commercial vehicle manufacturers represent a solid market for automobile brake manufacturers. These companies regularly purchase disc and drum brakes to outfit on heavy-duty trucks and buses. Freight operators and bus companies also regularly purchase replacement parts. While automobile manufacturing markets struggled through the current period, skyrocketing e-commerce buoyed demand for freight trucking and commercial vehicle markets. Many truck manufacturing companies increased production to handle elevated freight volumes, contributing to growth in 2022. Even so, high interest rates have prevented many smaller trucking companies from expanding fleets, limiting demand for new brake systems. However, infrastructure investment, innovation and other government initiatives have encouraged some freight operators to upgrade fleets, spurring demand."

In particular, steel prices skyrocketed, substantially raising purchase costs and preventing brake manufacturers from recovering quickly from the pandemic. Many companies struggled to pass costs onto buyers, given the overwhelming power that motor vehicle manufacturers hold in the industry. Regardless, leading brake manufacturers managed to keep up by leveraging long-term contracts and strong reputations."

As a result, wage growth has stagnated. Regardless, companies have heavily invested in research and development. Many manufacturers have prioritized the development of efficient regenerative braking systems and other more sustainable and safer technologies."

Major shortages and rising prices created uncertainty in planning input acquisition and production volumes, leading to longer lead times, higher costs and ultimately constraining profit. Substantial buyer and supplier power provide little wiggle room for brake manufacturers; steel is a necessary input, even though alternative materials are becoming more popular, while motor vehicle manufacturers are the industry's primary buyers."

            "question": "What are some trends impacting industry costs?",
            "answer": "Purchase costs are stabilizing after volatility from supply chain disruptions and spiking metal prices. The industry relies on skilled labor for R&D and innovation. Companies have generated limited profit amid economic uncertainty from input price volatility, buyer/supplier power dynamics, and impacts from the pandemic."
