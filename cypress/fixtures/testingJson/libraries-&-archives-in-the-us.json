    "executive_summary": "Libraries have a long and storied history, dating back thousands of years to the legendary Library of Alexandria. Even in today's digital age, they act as vital public institutions that provide free access to costly information and resources, contributing significantly to community development and literacy. Since library benefits are distributed as externalities across the community, funding for libraries primarily comes from local government sources, such as property taxes. However, budgets are often under pressure due to shifting priorities. Libraries have sought alternative funding sources like grants, donations and partnerships with private entities. Despite diverse funding, libraries struggle with underutilization and competition from substitutes.",
