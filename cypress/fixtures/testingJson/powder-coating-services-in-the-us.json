    "executive_summary": "Powder coating services have endured severe volatility through the current period because of the pandemic and skyrocketing interest rates. Many key buyers, like automakers, consumer electronics manufacturers and residential construction, rely on consumer demand; low interest rates and more time at home led to increased home improvement spending during the pandemic, bolstering furniture manufacturing markets. However, climbing interest rates have threatened this market despite lower office vacancies leading to greater demand for office furniture. Even so, pent-up demand for travel has led to rebounding automotive markets. The industry's market diversity has prevented one market's downturn from severely limiting the overall industry's growth. Revenue has climbed at an expected CAGR of 1.4% to $2.3 billion through the current period despite stagnating in 2024, where profit will reach an estimated 10.7%.",

Many key markets, especially consumer-facing markets, crashed in 2020 following severe economic uncertainty. However, strong residential construction markets uplifted demand in 2021 as homeowners heavily spent on home improvements, furniture and other items requiring powder coating."

Even so, federal, state and local governments have lifted lockdown restrictions, leading to pent-up demand for travel. This trend bolstered demand for new and used vehicles, leading to higher demand for powder coating services."
