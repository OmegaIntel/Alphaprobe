Key inputs like construction and electronics drive fluctuating demand. Revenue grew at an estimated 0.4% CAGR to $12.8B in 2024 when revenue declined 4.0% amid rising costs. The industry recovered strongly in 2021 as the economy reopened, with spiking commodity prices driving revenue. Since then, easing supply chains and poor Chinese performance lowered prices and revenue. Over the next 5 years, revenue should grow 0.4% to $13.0B as costs reduce.",
