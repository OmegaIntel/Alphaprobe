    "executive_summary": "Ambulatory surgery centers (ASCs) offer improved patient quality and care while cutting healthcare costs. Hospitals contend with scheduling delays, limited operating room capacity and budgetary issues for which ASCs provide a cost-effective alternative. Moreover, the advancement of medical technology has made many surgical techniques less invasive, enabling the performance of many inpatient procedures in outpatient settings. The industry's landscape has changed considerably as the medical sector has taken stock of ASCs' success. Once owned predominately by independent physicians, today, ASCs are a highly sought-after acquisition target by medical competitors like hospitals.",

            "current_performance_point_description": "ASCs have inundated the healthcare sector since the 1970s because they are a high-quality, yet cost-effective alternative to inpatient care administered by hospitals. Since hospitals face scheduling delays, slow operating room turnover times and budgetary issues that limit the ability to purchase new medical equipment, many patients opted for ASCs to receive care. With limited operating room availability in hospitals, further exacerbated by hospital consolidation, ASCs are appealing to many patients. ASCs now perform a range of surgeries, including ophthalmology, orthopedics, gastroenterology and pain management and can more efficiently schedule procedures than hospitals."

However, ASC ownership has shifted away from physician ownership. Hospitals have an ownership interest in about 21.0% of all ASCs, and 3.0% of ASCs are owned solely by hospitals. Hospitals have pursued either sole- or joint-ownership models with ASCs, enabled by the advent of new medical technologies that has reduced the number of procedures that are considered medically invasive."

To receive reimbursements from providing care to Medicare beneficiaries, ASCs must report data on quality measures to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid (CMS). Medicare reimbursements for industry services has significantly expanded to include more procedures, which has also permitted ASCs to bill Medicare separately for ancillary services. Further exacerbating the industry's exposure to regulations, many ASCs have also voluntarily complied with independent accrediting organization's requirements to appeal to patients on the basis of upholding the highest standards of care."

To demonstrate that they provide high-quality care, many ASCs are expected to continue voluntarily joining regulatory compliance entities, such as the ASC Quality Collaboration. The ASC Quality Collaboration sets quality measures, with some endorsed by the National Quality Forum (NQF). ASC will likely continue to provide low-cost services, which will be vital for Medicaid and Medicare to cut costs. According to the Ambulatory Surgery Center Association's (ASCA) analysis of Medicare procedure volumes, ASC procedures for Medicare beneficiaries will save billion every year moving forward."

The number of US residents aged 65 and older is projected to grow more quickly than the total population moving forward. As the population ages, the number of patients suffering from strokes or chronic diseases may increase, raising demand for industry services. Older patients already account for more than one-third of surgical procedures, and Medicare will continue to shift patients from hospital-based surgeries to the ambulatory surgery setting."

Hospitals will also access superior information technology systems and meet growing patient volumes with ASCs despite the more stringent reimbursement rules they are subject to. Large healthcare companies will be at the forefront of consolidation. UnitedHealth Group, the world's largest healthcare company by revenue, acquired 89 ASC with the purchase of Surgical Care Affiliates in 2022. In response, joint partnerships with hospitals will likely enable ASCs to provide more outpatient services despite the limited number of physicians available."
