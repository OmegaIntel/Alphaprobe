External employment trends driving up wages could challenge new stores balancing start-up costs. The rate of new patent technologies entering the industry is low, which limits the potential for innovations. A low rate does not mean that innovations cannot occur, just that the likelihood of some innovation materializing as a threat is lower. However, the concentration of technologies is high in this industry. This suggests that industry operators have exposure to potentially unforeseen areas of innovation. Major market segments for industry operators are relatively diversified. The spread of market segments suggests that there are limited entry points other than those already served by incumbent operators."
