    "executive_summary": "The Film Animation Services industry consists of companies that produce video animation for film and TV distribution companies. The industry has experienced inconsistent growth as animation techniques have become more sophisticated and high-value, with movie and TV studios continuing to vertically integrate industry-specific operations. The pandemic in 2020 compounded struggles and caused revenue to plummet double digits. Overall, industry revenue is expected to have fallen an annualized 3.0% to $271.7 million over the five years to 2023, including an anticipated rebound of 5.2% in 2023 alone. While revenue has struggled, industry profit only slightly waned as the industry has increasingly focused on advanced computer-generated animation, enabling animation companies to raise their rates.",
