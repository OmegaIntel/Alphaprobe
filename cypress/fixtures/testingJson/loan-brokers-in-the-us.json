    "executive_summary": "The US loan brokers industry enjoyed significant revenue growth through much of the five years to 2024 as interest rates hit record lows in the early years and consumer confidence soared. Low interest rates offered in the period and increased consumer spending spurred demand for mortgage and nonmortgage loan brokerage services, resulting in a surge in revenue of 33.8% in 2020 alone. These interest rates have steadily risen after the pandemic, bringing back a compressed lending environment in the latter half of the period. Loan brokers also continue to contend with educated consumers attracted to the easy lending processes popularized by online lenders.",
