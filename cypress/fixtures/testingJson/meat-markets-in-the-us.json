Health concerns have also encouraged consumers to opt for specialty meat products over conventional, mass-retailed products. Organic, grass-fed and custom cuts are just some of the products that have boosted foot traffic to meat markets during the period. With the swelling popularity of ethnic food, more consumers are seeking uncommon cuts of meat, including oxtail, lamb ribs and top-blade steak, which are often difficult to find in supermarkets or wholesale clubs.

The pandemic accelerated a trend toward health consciousness, which has had differing effects on meat market sales. Plant-based alternatives that mimic the taste and texture of meat are becoming more popular as consumers seek to expand their palates and consume less red meat for both health and environmental purposes. Still, meat remains a staple in the American diet and consumers have increasingly turned to butchers and delicatessens for organic, sustainable and high-quality meats. Rising disposable income has also supported demand for these high-margin meat products."

Demand for value-added meat products from butchers and delicatessens will persist, contributing to marginal growth for meat markets.
