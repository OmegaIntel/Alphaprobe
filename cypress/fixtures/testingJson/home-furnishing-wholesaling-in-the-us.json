    "executive_summary": "Many home furnishing manufacturers have rolled out internalized distribution processes and begun selling their goods directly to retailers. The adoption of this direct-sales model has led to the expansion of manufacturers that can use their own distribution networks to ship directly to consumers and retailers. Bypassing merchant wholesalers has enabled vertically integrated manufacturers to reach end users at a lower price, as well as provided retailers with more pricing flexibility by purchasing at lower costs. This shift has sapped revenue away from many wholesalers that rely on their position as middlemen between manufacturers and retailers. Volatile input costs through the COVID-19 pandemic have combined with this fierce price competition to drive down profit for home furnishing wholesalers.",

            "current_performance_point_description": "Home furnishing wholesalers had stagnant revenue growth in the two years prior to the COVID-19 pandemic as the value of private residential construction declined, offset by rising private spending on home improvements. The pandemic led to a bump in home improvement spending as stay-at-home ordinances led consumers to update their decor and furnish new remote offices. In 2020, both housing starts and the value of residential construction rose, bringing higher demand for hardwood floors to complete construction and products to furnish new homes."

In 2022, per capita disposable income fell for the first time in nine years, dampening consumers' spending on home furnishing goods."

            "current_performance_point_description": "While 2020 and 2021 saw rising residential construction values, values fell in 2022 as inflation led the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates, deterring investment. The value of nonresidential construction has continued to decline as well, and the slowing of demand from both of these sectors directly translated to fewer housing starts. Fewer housing starts means less business for home furnishing wholesalers, and the industry faced a 5.5% decline in revenue in 2022. The values of both residential and nonresidential construction have continued to decline in 2023, pressuring the industry with another year of revenue loss."

This trend will persist over the next five years, siphoning business away from home furnishing wholesalers. Many big retailers operate their own brands of home furnishings, and wholesalers will have fewer big-box retail clients and more competitors more stores follow suit. Strong e-commerce growth will promote buying of home furnishings from cheap overseas competitors like Alibaba."

            "answer": "Home furnishing wholesalers sell a variety of products, like linens, flooring, kitchenware, and bedding. Wholesalers will sell an increasing variety of products of imported goods to secure a position in the marketplace."
        },
        {
            "question": "Are your sales heavily dependent on the health of the US economy?",
            "answer": "The health of the US economy is extremely important to this industry, which relies on per capita disposable income and private spending on home improvements. Housing starts influence demand for home furnishings, which are needed for new homes."
        },
        {
            "question": "Has your company been exposed to volatile input prices over the past few years?",
            "answer": "Stabilization in the price of lumber has stabilized purchasing costs for the industry. The price of lumber can be volatile and can threaten profit margins for manufacturers, who can pass on the increased costs to wholesalers. Supply chain disruptions in 2020 led to a surge in lumber prices."
        },
        {
            "question": "Has your company explored acquisition opportunities in locations with well-established infrastructure networks?",
            "answer": "Wholesalers are located near downstream retailers, particularly in the Southeast and Western United States. Close proximity to upstream suppliers also allows wholesalers to save on transportation costs."
        },
        {
            "question": "Does your company use SAP software systems for inventory management and customer records?",
            "answer": "SAP software has been increasingly adopted to making distribution processes more efficient, improve inventory management and better serve customers. SAP systems allow wholesalers to access real-time information, improve inventory management, and manage customer lists. Such technology can save on labor-intensive inventory management systems."
        },
        {
            "question": "Have you been able to reduce wage costs by automating operations over the past five years?",
            "answer": "Automated shipping and inventory management technology has reduced the need for unskilled labor over the past five years. By mitigating labor expenses, advanced technologies allow wholesalers to improve operational efficiencies. Upstream manufacturers have increasingly used automation in production processes, which have reduced costs, thus reduce purchase prices for industry operators."
        },
        {
            "question": "How does your company stay ahead of regulations regarding workplace safety?",
            "answer": "Home furnishing wholesalers ensure a safe working environment by standardizing operational procedures across locations. These operations are often small, and so workplace safety takes a more intimate role. During the pandemic, wholesalers had to limit operations to lower the number of people in a facility at a given point, facilitating social distancing."

        {
            "question": "What effect have international tariffs had on your ability to import and export products?",
            "answer": "Wholesalers who specialize in the import of foreign home furnishings will be negatively impacted by increased tariffs. Such tariffs could increase purchase costs and hamper profit margin. Tariffs have remained relatively stable in recent years."
        },
        {
            "question": "How has price volatility of inputs affected profit margins over the past months?",
            "answer": "Increases in the price of crude oil threaten profit margins by increasing transportation costs for distributors. As oil prices rise, input costs for wholesalers increase; such increases are often internalized as few cost increases can be passed onto retail stores."
        },
        {
            "question": "How does your company compensate for the seasonality of cash flow?",
            "answer": "Home furnishing wholesalers offer a wide variety of products that are useful throughout the year. Demand for some products, like bedding, changes based on the season, so a variety of products is needed."

        {
            "question": "Do you have contracts with reliable input providers?",
            "answer": "Access to and contracts with reliable manufacturers or importers are essential to fulfilling orders from retailers. Establishing contracts can also limit price volatility."
        },
        {
            "question": "Do your potential hires need to have past knowledge of the product?",
            "answer": "It is important for staff to have a sound technical knowledge of all products to communicate and negotiate with clients and suppliers. Providing quality customer service can help to retain customers, despite a general shift from wholesalers due to rising e-commerce activity."
        },
        {
            "question": "Where are your distribution centers located?",
            "answer": "Since many of the industry's products are large and costly to transport, being located by key downstream markets can limit distribution expenses."
