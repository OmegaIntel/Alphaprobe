The world price of steel is the most pertinent performance driver, as wholesalers primarily engage in wholesale iron, steel and ferrous products. The pandemic hit China, which has the world's largest steel reserves and the United States. The substantial drop in the need for metals caused an extended period of uncertainty for domestic wholesalers."

Renewed economic activity has driven producers to increase output to capitalize on increased spending. Still, the large decline amid the pandemic effectively offset future increases, causing the industrial production index to display no material change during the five years, further contributing to the industry's stagnancy."

Notably, China, a major global supplier of metals, endured major disruptions in its trade abilities. This sudden and unforeseen drop in metals prices led to a drastic drop in returns for wholesalers; supply chain issues forced wholesalers to either hold inventory or sell at a loss."

        "Volatile metal prices present a significant challenge for wholesalers, introducing substantial uncertainty in their pricing strategies. Stable prices allow for predictable expense calculation and consistent profitability, whereas rapid fluctuations complicate cost transfer to buyers and can erode profit.",
        "Fluctuations in industrial production significantly impact wholesalers' success, as their operations hinge on the steady flow of input metals from producers. When industrial production rises, demand for metals increases, allowing wholesalers to maintain consistent inventory turnover. Conversely, declines can disrupt this balance.",
        "Larger wholesalers dominate the market because of economies of scale, which allow them to lower per-unit costs through bulk purchasing and streamlined operations. They also benefit from better resource access, including capital, technology and extensive distribution networks, enhancing their competitive edge.",
        "Upstream producers face stringent regulations to reduce the environmental impact of extraction processes, which increases operational costs. Meanwhile, downstream producers encounter decreasing demand because of tighter environmental standards, complicating market dynamics and pressuring companies to adapt swiftly to regulatory changes.",
        "The construction industry is increasingly important as it compensates for declines in the mining sector and the offshoring of manufacturing. As these traditional industries face challenges, construction projects drive demand for materials and labor, becoming essential economic buyers.",
