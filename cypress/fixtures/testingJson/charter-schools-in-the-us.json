    "executive_summary": "Funded by the same public sources, charter schools offer primary- and secondary-level programs more flexible in curriculum design and implementation than traditional public schools. Charter schools receive nearly all their funding from federal, state and local governments, so revenue can fluctuate significantly based on budgetary decisions tied to tax income. However, many charter schools are funded per pupil, enabling schools to drive up enrollment without worrying about financial support. Sustained long-term growth in charter school enrollment saw its first setback in 2022 as alternatives became much more attractive, though growth in per-pupil funding helped offset shrinking student bodies. Overall, industry revenue is anticipated to climb at a CAGR of 0.5% to an estimated $49.6 billion through the end of 2024, including a 0.3% increase in 2024 alone.",

Parents in these households are much more likely to choose private schools over charter schools for their kids, dampening enrollment in the industry's schools. Homeschooling has become massively popular throughout the current period, especially following the onset of COVID-19. According to US Census Bureau data, the number of homeschooling households more than doubled from the 2019-2020 school year to the next. Students in minority groups make up a disproportionately high percentage of charter school student bodies, and the industry's primary demographics were especially enthusiastic about this alternative. Homeschooling skyrocketed fivefold among African American households."

Demand for charter schools is closely tied to population trends. Government funding, which nearly entirely funds charter schools, fluctuates with student numbers, geographic location, facilities provided and other criteria. Larger schools receive more funding, as they're more expensive to operate. Charter schools need to be conveniently located near parents. Students won't travel far to attend school, so the industry is fragmented into many schools catering to local demand."
