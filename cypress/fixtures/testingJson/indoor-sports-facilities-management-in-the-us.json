Operators manage indoor recreational sports facilities, which does not include bowling alleys and college facilities. Over the past five years, higher sports participation rates and growing public awareness of the link between physical activity and health led to an increase in demand for operators' services, as rising per capita disposable income expanded consumer spending. Nonetheless, the economic downturn due to the pandemic erased these gains, as temporary closures of establishments resulted in a sharp 31.2% decline in revenue in 2020.",
