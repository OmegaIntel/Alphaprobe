    "executive_summary": "The Book, Magazine and Newspaper Wholesaling industry has remained in a state of rapid decline. Print media has declined in line with the increased consumption of digital news and entertainment fueled by mobile device proliferation. Simultaneously, wholesalers have become less involved in distributing print media, and retail stores have decreased their magazine offerings. Publishers have also boosted their circulation by offering discounted subscriptions, which are mailed directly to consumers without the aid of a wholesale distributor. Meanwhile, the number of brick-and-mortar bookstores has contracted, reducing the industry's largest and most natural customer base. Revenue is expected to shrink at a CAGR of 2.7% to $11.4 billion through the end of 2024, including a dip of 0.6% during 2024.",
