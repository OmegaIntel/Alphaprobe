    "executive_summary": "The pandemic brought myriad challenges to ambulance service providers. As the pandemic spurred the need for emergency ambulance services, operating costs rose from heightened safety measures and pressure on wages, reducing profit. Meanwhile, the suspension of nonemergency procedures impacted service volume, leading to a drop in that segment's revenue. These impacts highlighted the potential benefits of industry-wide restructuring, improved cost management and expanded government support. Fortunately, despite the challenges, industry-wide revenue has grown at a CAGR of 1.3% over the past five years. It is expected to total $21.2 billion in 2024 when revenue will rally by an estimated 1.3%.",
