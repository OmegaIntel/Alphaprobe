    "executive_summary": "The Child Education and Developmental Center Franchises industry has posted strong growth over the majority of the past decade. An increasing body of research supporting the benefits of early childhood education has fostered rising parental interest in education-based child care. Industry franchises provide center-based child care primarily for children younger than six, typically with a focus on promoting mathematics, literacy and language-based skills. Over the five years to 2022, industry revenue is estimated to grow an annualized 1.6% to $3.7 billion, including an increase of 2.2% in 2022 alone. Profit, measured as earnings before interest and taxes, is estimated to account for 14.5% of total industry revenue in 2022.",

According to Child Care Aware, the average cost of center-based infant care accounts for an average of 36.0% of household income in 2019. The high cost of care has been exacerbated by families with more than one child and for families living at or below the poverty line."
