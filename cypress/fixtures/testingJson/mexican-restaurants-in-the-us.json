        "Franchise agreements can lower operational costs and minimize some risks, especially for inexperienced persons entering the industry. Therefore, major chains have expanded their franchisee-owned locations, capturing more customer demand.",
        "There is significant competition among restaurants to obtain suitable sites, which has increased the cost of many prime sites. Generally, rent can vary between establishments, with quick-service locations paying less because their square footage is smaller than sit-down restaurants.",
        "Immigration growth fuels Mexican restaurants' popularity. The increasing immigrant population has led to the expansion and establishment of these eateries in unlikely places. Their affordability, compared to other ethnic food, makes them a prime choice for consumers.",
        "As American household incomes improve, spending at restaurants will likely grow. Mexican restaurants will likely benefit from greater foot traffic and higher average checks.",
        "Low barriers to entry allow new restaurants to enter the market with ease. Further, due to the industry's highly fragmented nature, only one company accounts for more than 5.0% of market share.",
        "A provision of the US Affordable Care Act requires that restaurant chains with over 20 locations post the food's calorie content. New research finds that menu items introduced after calorie labeling contained about 25.0% fewer calories on average than dishes introduced before labeling.",
        "If the restaurant serves alcohol, there are additional regulations to follow. These laws can dictate everything from how and when alcohol can be served to how it must be stored and who can handle it.",
        "Due to the high number of franchised businesses, franchise royalties and other fees can account for a significant proportion of industry revenue. This cost will rise further in coming years.",
        "Due to the labor-intense nature of this industry, most enterprises experience high wage and purchase costs. Food prices have been volatile over the past five years.",
