However, these hindrances were offset by a boom in online video streaming and surge in demand for media content. Significant consolidation occurred, with large traditional cable and TV providers expanding into streaming. Over the past five years, revenue climbed at a CAGR of 0.8% to $212.9 billion in 2024, with profit reaching 14.7%. Over the next five years, revenue is forecast to grow at a CAGR of 2.1% to $236.7 billion, with profit inching up to 15.0% in 2029.",
