    "executive_summary": "The field of Electronic Design Automation (EDA) software is fundamental to the creation and advancement of microchips, which are indispensable in a wide range of consumer and business applications incorporating different electronic devices. As the advancement in microchip technology has progressed over the five years to 2023, the need for specialized software for research into innovative designs and for reducing costs in the overall chip design procedure has grown significantly. Consequently, the EDA Software industry has expanded, increasing at a CAGR of 9.5% to $13.4 billion over the five years to 2023, including an increase of 2.7% in 2023 alone. Heightened investment in computers and software by businesses, changes in semiconductor technology and shifts in aggregate consumer electronics demand are all responsible. In addition, the negative influence COVID-19 had on this field was not felt in 2020 or 2021; instead, a profit surge was observed as chip demand expanded.",
