The broad variety of products manufactured by this industry insulates the industry from shifts in demand for any particular product line, while the medically necessary nature of many of its products keeps overall relatively demand steady. The industry has contended with increased import penetration over the five years to 2021, in addition to the COVID-19 (coronavirus) pandemic, leading the industry to contract. As a result, industry revenue is expected to fall during the current period, decreasing at an annualized rate of 2.2% to $633.2 million. However, due to increasing demand for industry exports, combined with a domestic recovery in healthcare utilization and consumer spending, industry revenue is forecast to grow 1.5% in 2021 alone.",
