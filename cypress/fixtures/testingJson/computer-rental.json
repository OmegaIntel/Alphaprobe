Although the necessity of computers has grown for consumers and businesses, the price of computers and peripheral equipment has steadily declined, making it less expensive for industry customers to purchase rather than rent computers.",

According to a survey conducted by the Equipment Leasing and Finance Association, the ability to have the latest equipment was leasing's top perceived benefit. Moreover, these companies also rent computers for tax purposes because computers that are leased or rented can be listed as an expense rather than a depreciable asset. Some businesses also rent computers for conferences, trade shows and other events to avoid the risk and hassle of transporting in-house equipment. This market is anticipated to decline as a share of revenue in 2022 as effects from the outbreak of the COVID-19 (coronavirus) pandemic, such as temporary closure of nonessential businesses and decline in corporate profit, linger.",

The total price premium associated with such an agreement is typically higher than the interest that would be accrued through most credit cards, reflecting the low level of financial acumen among the industry's consumers.
