When the COVID-19 pandemic began to spread, though, fine arts schools were forced to contend with plummeting enrollment as lockdowns prevented social gathering and skyrocketing unemployment left many unable to partake in their favorite recreational pastimes. As the pandemic began to subside and fine arts schools were once again able to open their doors, attendance returned revenue jumped in 2021 and 2022. This began to offset the massive drop in revenue in 2020, though growth was severely slowed as widespread inflation left many with little disposable income.",
