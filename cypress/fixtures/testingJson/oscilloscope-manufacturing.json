    "executive_summary": "The Oscilloscope Manufacturing industry provides oscilloscopes used to provide observation of constantly varying signal voltages. Over the five years to 2021, industry revenue has experienced significant growth, primarily driven by product innovation and rising international demand. Research and development expenditure (R&D) has grown at an annualized rate of 1.6% during the current five-year period. With increased R&D expenditure, industry operators have extended their product lines, creating more demand for industry products. As a result, industry revenue has increased at an annualized rate of 5.4% to $496.0 million over the five years to 2021. However, in 2020, the COVID-19 (coronavirus) pandemic caused disruptions in manufacturing supply. However, as the economy has slowly recovered from the pandemic, industry revenue is expected to increase an estimated 2.1%. Notably, industry exports have grown at an annualized rate of 6.6% to $88.2 million during the five-year period, primarily driven by the international demand in the Asia-Pacific region. The Asia-Pacific region has the largest number of electronics and electronic component manufacturers, resulting in a higher demand for electronic test and measurement instruments, such as oscilloscopes. However, import competition, higher R&D costs and increased wages have placed downward pressure on the average industry profit margin. Average industry profit, measured as earnings before interest and taxes, is expected to account for 9.5% in 2021, a decrease from 10.4% in 2016. Over the five years to 2026, industry revenue is expected to grow at an annualized rate of 3.4% to $586.3 million.",
