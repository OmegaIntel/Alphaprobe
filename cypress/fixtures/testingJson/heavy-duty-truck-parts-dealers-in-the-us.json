    "executive_summary": "The Heavy Duty Truck Parts Dealers industry has experienced an overall decline in revenue in recent years. Industry revenue has benefited from an increase in the average age of vehicle fleet, which increased demand from truck repair and maintenance service providers. However, truck manufacturers demanded fewer heavy duty truck parts during the period, harming revenue growth. The COVID-19 pandemic negatively affected industry revenue, with steel prices increasing and demand from downstream markets decreasing in 2020. While overall positive trends are expected to have supported industry revenue in the years following 2020, the industry has not yet fully recovered.",

Stay-at-home measures limited the need for individual transportation, causing demand for buses to fall. Decreased consumer confidence and disposable income drove down business activity overall, lessening the need for freight trucking."

Although revenue greatly increased following the height of the pandemic, this growth was not enough to offset declines completely."

Corporate profit will steadily rise, leading to increased business activity and demand for freight trucking.

As spending remains high, goods will continue to be shipped across the country, causing steady demand, especially as wear and tear on existing trucks necessitates upgrades."
