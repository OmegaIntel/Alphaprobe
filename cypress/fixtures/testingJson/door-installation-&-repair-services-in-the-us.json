    "executive_summary": "Properly installing and repairing doors is essential for both residential and commercial properties. Installing doors can be tricky, often taken on by professionals focusing on doors instead of general contractors. Door specialists purchase materials, frame doors, embed latches and set up garage doors during a building's construction. Experts are also called on to service automatic doors, repair garage doors and springs. Since 2019, door installation has been rocked by COVID-19, interest rate hikes and growth in lumber prices, raising revenue at a CAGR of 0.6% to $7.7 billion in 2024, including a forecast 1.0% growth during the current year.",
