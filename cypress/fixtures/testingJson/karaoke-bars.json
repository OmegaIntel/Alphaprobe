    "executive_summary": "Escalating external competition and tepid growth in alcohol expenditure have constrained revenue growth for the Karaoke Bars industry over the five years to 2021. Consumer spending has assuaged these factors somewhat, as renewed interest in high-end karaoke bars has stimulated consumer interest in urban areas. While the primary driver behind the industry's structural decline has been the continued shift of karaoke fans away from karaoke bars and into the comfort of their own homes, growth in the domestic economy and increased consumer spending prevented substantial decline over the five years to 2021. However, added pressures during the COVID-19 (coronavirus) pandemic ultimately drove down industry revenue, resulting in revenue declining an estimated annualized 0.7% over the five years to 2021 to $1.1 billion, including a 17.1% surge in 2021 alone amid economic recovery.",

During the period, the industry has contended with mounting external competition and muted alcohol expenditure growth. The industry's long-term decline has been mitigated somewhat by two factors. First, consumer spending has increased an annualized 2.4% over the past five years as the domestic economy has grown and per capita disposable income has increased."

These developments have lured consumers away from karaoke bars, which is challenging for industry operators, as the majority of their revenue is sourced from alcoholic beverages consumed within their establishments.

Karaoke systems now offer touch-screen playlists that are easy to use and backed by an impressive library of new and old songs, listed digitally with an on-screen search function. However, external competition is expected to continue to challenge industry operators, pressuring industry profit."

Thus, revenue is anticipated to increase at an annualized rate of 0.4% over the next five years to total $1.1 million. As a means to counteract the industry's structural decline, karaoke bars are anticipated to more closely focus on their target markets in the years ahead, primarily individuals aged 35 and younger. Further, they are anticipated to offer higher quality products and services, such as improved technology to attract more consumers. Despite technological investments to draw in these consumers, the number of industry establishments is anticipated to continue declining over the five years to 2026."

This will come specifically from the continued competition from external options, such as in-home and internet-based karaoke systems, other bar formats and other group-oriented nightlife activities. Despite competitive pressures, a sharp return to bars, including karaoke bars, as restrictions ease, revenue for the Karaoke Bars industry is forecast to rise at an annualized rate of 0.4% over the five years to 2026 to reach $1.1 billion."

However, the industry is expected to return to its long-term decline as the industry contends with mounting competitive pressures. As consumer confidence falls, patrons will be more likely to conserve their spending and choose to eat and drink at home more often, reducing the amount consumers spend at karaoke bars. Although consumer spending is expected to increase at an annualized rate of 2.5% over the five years to 2026, these trends are not anticipated to be sufficient enough to offset the long-term decline in demand for karaoke bars due to competition from video games and internet-based karaoke systems."
