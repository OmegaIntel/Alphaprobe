Pioneered and introduced in the United Kingdom in 2005, P2P lending platforms facilitate loans from individual investors that pool their money via operators' online platforms to loan money to consumers and small businesses. The industry's competitive advantage lies in its proprietary credit evaluation algorithms, which go beyond FICO credit scores used by traditional lending institutions.",

With lower rates, consumers felt more comfortable using new fintech services like P2P but low interest rates meant less interest fees earned by P2P lenders, hurting revenue growth. - Many P2P lender start-ups used the low-rate environment to invest and expand operations which helped the industry grow following the pandemic."

With higher rates, P2P lenders were able to receive higher interest fees earned, which has resulted in revenue growth for the industry every year following the pandemic. Supply chain issues and a global energy crisis created historically high inflation. In 2022, the Federal Reserve began hiking interest rates to control inflation. Higher interest rates are reducing liquidity in the financial markets. The P2P lender start-ups that use debt to sustain growth are likely to face serious hardship if rates keep increasing."
