Yet the service gap between those who need and receive treatment underscores the opportunities for growth at centers or new entry. High utilization rates at substance abuse residential centers indicate stress on service levels, with geographic data showing some locations are underserved relative to the population. With room to grow, industry-wide revenue grew at a CAGR of 2.2% to $24.3 billion over the past five years, including a moderate dip of 0.2% in 2023 alone.",

Government funding also increased, allowing expansion of capacity and improved quality of care. Revenue grew 4.2% annualized to $26.8 billion over 2019-2024, including 3.9% growth in 2021.

Profit was buoyed by a 14.9% boost in government assistance during the pandemic.

Industry fragmentation helps counter competitive forces and supports steady costs. With private equity investment signaling growth in the for-profit segment, profit is expected to remain stable."

This demand has grown further as fentanyl, a highly potent synthetic opioid, has become more common, dramatically increasing overdose risk. The fentanyl crisis has created greater need for residential substance use treatment and prompted more public/private funding for it.
