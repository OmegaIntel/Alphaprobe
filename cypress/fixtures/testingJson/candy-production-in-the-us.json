Since candy provides little nutritional value, it is considered a discretionary good. When economic conditions are poor or uncertain, consumers reduce candy purchases. At the height of the pandemic, candy sales nearly stalled before booming in the following year. Still, producers were unable to maintain the growth, as import competition intensified with a strengthening US dollar. As a result, revenue increased at a CAGR of 1.4% to $12.9 billion through 2023, including a 2.6% decline in 2023 alone.",
