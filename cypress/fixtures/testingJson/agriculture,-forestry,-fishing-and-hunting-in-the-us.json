Precision agriculture enabled by digital tools has increased efficiency and profitability, with revenue growing at 3.6% CAGR to $532 billion from 2018-2023. Legal changes like allowing double cropping aim to boost domestic production. However, sustainability issues like chemical impact, labor conditions, and animal welfare need addressing. While initially expensive, sustainability aligns with societal expectations and climate resilience. Despite pandemic-driven financial gains, inflation and supply chain risks may cause revenue to fall 0.3% to $524.3 billion by 2028, though profitability remains robust.",
