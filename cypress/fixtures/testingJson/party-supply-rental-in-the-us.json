    "executive_summary": "Figures have been adjusted for inflation and are presented in 2024 currency. Party Supply Rental providers rent tables, chairs, audio equipment, tents and other related supplies to host events. Through the end of 2024, rising disposable income and growth in downstream markets have spurred demand for events that require party supplies. However, the pandemic hurt sales as large gatherings were prohibited to prevent the virus spread. Nonetheless, a mixture of robust growth in marriage rates, coupled with pent-up consumer demand following the pandemic, enabled a rapid recovery for rental providers. Revenue is expected to swell at a CAGR of 1.8% to $7.3 billion through the end of 2024, despite a forecast dip of 0.2% in 2024. Moving forward, demand for party supplies will continue to expand as economic growth encourages consumers and businesses to host events.",
