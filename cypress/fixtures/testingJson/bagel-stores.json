    "executive_summary": "The Bagel Stores industry comprises small shops selling bagels, coffee and other breakfast foods. For many people, bagels are a staple breakfast, particularly for workers and people in cities. While demand for bagels typically grows when disposable income levels increase, industry establishments cater to people across income brackets. While people with lower incomes are more likely to make breakfast at home to save money, bagels are often inexpensive enough that the convenience of a fast breakfast can outweigh the cost. Over much of the five years to 2022, disposable income levels increased, keeping demand for bagels mostly consistent. Additionally, per capita coffee consumption has increased, spurring demand for bagel stores, since bagels are a compliment to coffee and a customer buying a coffee may make the spontaneous decision to buy a bagel as well.",
