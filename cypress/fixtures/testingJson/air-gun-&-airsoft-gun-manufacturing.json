    "executive_summary": "Figures have been adjusted for inflation and are presented in 2020 currency. Operators in the Air Gun and Airsoft Gun Manufacturing industry have experienced volatile conditions over the five years to 2020. Industry operators develop and produce guns that shoot projectiles, including BBs and pellets, using compressed air to propel the ammo instead of an explosive. Industry products are used for various recreational, hunting and sporting activities, including target shooting. After benefiting from years of pent-up demand, the industry began to normalize early during the period as demand leveled. Combined with falling exports and lower participation in hunting, industry revenue began to falter. Rising discretionary income was not enough to encourage sales of industry products. Thus, industry revenue has decreased an annualized 2.7% to $291.1 million over the five years to 2020, including a decline of 0.3% in 2020 alone as consumers encountered an adverse social and economic climate caused by the COVID-19 (coronavirus) pandemic.",
