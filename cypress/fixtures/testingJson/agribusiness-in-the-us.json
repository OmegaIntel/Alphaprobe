        },
        {
            "question": "Has your company been exposed to excess revenue volatility?",
            "answer": "Diversified agribusiness producers exhibit lower degrees of revenue volatility, aiding profitability. Undiversified producers will be more subject to output price fluctuations, hindering profitability."
        },
        {
            "question": "Is your company located in proximity to key buying and selling markets?",
            "answer": "Agricultural producers located closer to key selling markets will face lower transportation costs and higher profitability. Agribusiness food producers located in proximity to key input suppliers will exhibit lower purchase costs and higher profitability."
        },
        {
            "question": "How is your company leveraging the latest technologies?",
            "answer": "Crop yields can be improved and stabilized via automated technology such as drones and crop monitors, making for more reliable harvests. Food processors leveraging the latest technologies will exhibit higher operating efficiency and higher profitability. Drones can be used to monitor crops at a fraction of the cost, increasing operational efficiencies."

        {
            "question": "How does your profit margin compare to those of your biggest competitors?",
            "answer": "Food processors that adopt the latest technologies will exhibit higher operating efficiencies. Agricultural producers that enter into long-term supply contracts will face lower revenue volatility and higher profitability."
        },
        {
            "question": "Has your company had any difficulty financing current operations?",
            "answer": "Agricultural producers that enter into long-term supply contracts will have more stable revenue, enduring price declines better and experiencing less profit volatility. Agricultural producers will often produce at a loss, which is then made up for via government subsidies."

            "question": "Do you monitor the agricultural price index? How do you prepare yourself for low agricultural prices?",
            "answer": "Higher prices of products can also have a negative effect if producers have difficulty passing on these prices to downstream buyers. Since this is a supply-side industry, price increases will reflect growing scarcity or rising costs of production, both of which can only be partially passed onto customers without limiting demand."
        },
        {
            "question": "How does the growth of the US population affect demand for your services? Does your revenue trend in line with population growth?",
            "answer": "Over the long term, demand for food and the goods and services of agribusiness is determined by the total population in the United States. Food is part of a fixed caloric diet. Total calorie needs will be determined by the level of the population."

        {
            "question": "Do you monitor the trade-weighted index? Has your company been affected by import penetration?",

An appreciation of the US dollar raises the price of domestic crops in international markets, eroding the industry's price competitiveness. Poor trade relations with China and a pullback in international trade resulting from COVID-19 have also hampered exports."
