    "executive_summary": "The escalating threat of climate change has significantly amplified demand for damage restoration services both within the United States and worldwide. Each year, environmental calamities from wildfires and floods to earthquakes and tornadoes grow stronger and more frequent. This rise in catastrophes has inadvertently benefited damage restoration service providers. However, it has also led several insurance and reinsurance companies, including Nationwide, Allstate and Berkshire Hathaway, to retract their support from areas persistently stricken by such costly disasters. These areas primarily include coastal regions susceptible to flooding and swathes of California severely hit by disastrous wildfires. Industry revenue is estimated to increase at a CAGR of 4.5% to $7.1 billion over five years to 2024, despite a 2.1% decrease in 2024 alone.",

The CARES Act and PPP, part of the government's COVID response, temporarily reduced the financial burden on households requiring restoration services. With the exhaustion of stimulus payments and continued inflation, consumers are finding it increasingly difficult to afford these critical services. Both households and businesses are opting to delay damage restoration services until they have greater financial stability."
