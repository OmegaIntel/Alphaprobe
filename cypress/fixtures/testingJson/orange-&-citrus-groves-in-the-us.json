            "question": "Has your farm explored producing organic fruit?",
            "answer": "Organic trends don't influence most fruit-growing industries."
        },
        {
            "question": "How does your business cope with changes in the market price of citrus?",
            "answer": "Crop and fruit prices largely determine farm revenue since the industry passes on high prices to their buyers."

            "question": "Does your farm use any genetically modified crops or other biotechnology products?",
            "answer": "Genetically modified organisms have minimal influence on fruit and vegetable growers. Some farmers have sought to use genetic modification to halt citrus greening, but this has been met with regulatory concerns and a lack of consumer acceptance."
        },
        {
            "question": "Has your company explored using automated harvesting or planting equipment?",
            "answer": "Citrus growers typically have a moderate level of technology. Farmers have been increasingly applying satellite imagery and GPS technology to identify any potential problems with their crops and optimize resource use. Companies have also been employing soil moisture sensors to ensure citrus trees receive the correct amount of water."
        },
        {
            "question": "Do you receive any federal subsidies? How much of your revenue do they comprise?",
            "answer": "Federal subsidies for citrus growers vary based on production volumes. Assistance includes crop insurance programs, direct payments and price supports, research and development funding and emergency aid."
        },

            "question": "Do you find that demand for fresh fruit and vegetables is affected by attitudes toward nutrition? Why do you think consumption is going to decrease?",
            "answer": "Fruit and vegetable retailers are important outlets for the fresh fruit produced by this industry. Fruit sold on the fresh market provides substantially higher returns for growers than processed fruit. As demand from retailers increases, so will revenue."
        },
        {
            "question": "As the population continues to grow, do you see a change in your revenue? Are you prepared to meet the rising demand for citrus?",
            "answer": "In addition to rising per capita citrus fruit consumption, the expanding population helps increase the total level of consumption and boosts revenue growth. At the same time, a rapidly expanding population can lead to residential development in land that had previously been devoted to citrus groves, decreasing the acreage devoted to citrus crops. For this reason, population growth can have alternating effects on revenue."
