    "executive_summary": "Figures have been adjusted for inflation and are presented in 2024 currency. Mineral and phosphate miners have seen their share of ups and downs in recent years, mainly driven by erratic commodity prices and various economic disruptions. Revenue and profit have been on a rollercoaster ride, oscillating with fluctuating demand and prices for key minerals like sulfur, soda ash, phosphate rock and salt. The pandemic initially depressed prices for some minerals, delivering a blow to revenue, but an economic rebound fueled a surge in demand and, in turn, prices for these commodities. Even so, prices came down to earth towards the end of the period, leading to revenue dips. Overall, revenue is set to lag at a CAGR of 0.6%, reaching $8.4 billion, including a 0.4% dip in 2024.",
