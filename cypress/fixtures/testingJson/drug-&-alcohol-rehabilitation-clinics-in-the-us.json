    "executive_summary": "Swelling awareness of the importance of substance abuse treatment has supported drug and alcohol rehabilitation clinics in recent years. Medicare and Medicaid coverage expansion and program funding through SAMHSA have aligned with the changing societal attitudes toward drug and alcohol abuse. The expansion of clinics has been vital, as strengthening rates of substance abuse and a worsening opioid epidemic boost the need for accessible treatment. COVID-19 exacerbated preexisting rates of substance abuse in the US. Long periods of stress and isolation pushed many people to drugs and alcohol to cope, while the CDC is attributing the swelling use of fentanyl to an unprecedented overdose death rate. Pandemic-related operating and labor challenges have strained clinics' ability to meet the record-high demand.",

Medicare and Medicaid's coverage expansion and more significant funding through the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Administration (SAMHSA) has aligned with the changing societal attitudes toward drug and alcohol abuse, strengthening access to care. Despite this, strengthening incomes, broader insurance coverage and changing attitudes have led industry-wide revenue to expand at a CAGR of 3.3% over the past five years, totaling an estimated $5.3 billion in 2024, when revenue is slated to expand 2.2%."

Population expansion, COVID-related stressors, low reimbursement rates and external employment trends are factors behind shortages. Hiring challenges constrain profit expansion, as wages have swelled alongside revenue to attract and retain staff. Consolidation activity has reached record levels, as a highly fragmented, favorable insurance coverage and growing demand present massive opportunities."

A combination of long-lasting pandemic effects, societal factors, mental health considerations and the chronic nature of addiction indicate that demand for clinics will remain at a record high. Drug and alcohol rehabilitation clinics haven't been able to keep pace with the need. This will pour over into clinics moving forward, as long waiting periods and pent-up demand keep the number of people seeking care high."
