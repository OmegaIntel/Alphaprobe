Activated carbon is processed with oxygen to create pores between carbon atoms, increasing their surface area and enabling activated carbon to absorb contaminants as liquid or gas passes through it. Activated carbon is used primarily for water treatment and air purification. A range of downstream industrial sectors rely on activated carbon for the removal of impurities. The industry is beholden to industrial production activity as it is typically correlated with the issuance of additional contaminants and an increased need for activated carbon products.",

The proliferation of activated carbon manufacturers in emerging markets has intensified competition for domestic activated carbon manufacturers, causing industry revenue to decline. Demand began to bounce back in 2021 as the economy was recovering from the pandemic. This period of economic recovery significantly increased worldwide demand for coal, causing input costs to rise for the industry."
