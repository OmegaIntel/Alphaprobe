    "executive_summary": "Over the past five years, chicken egg producers have had to contend with severe revenue volatility. While per capita egg consumption has remained stable, a severe drought across most of the United States pushed the price of feed upward. This, combined with lingering challenges from supply chain bottlenecks and highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI), have pushed the price of eggs upward. Widespread inflation in 2022 also contributed to surging egg prices, and while the industry benefited from an upswing in revenue that year, price spikes set the stage for plummeting prices in 2023. As a result, industry-wide revenue has dropped at a CAGR of 2.4% to $11.3 billion over the five years to 2023, when revenue will drop an estimated 14.5%.",

The US Department of Agriculture's (USDA) Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) has been integral to catching detections early and containing the virus. Losses to flock sizes have dampened production volumes and contributed to rising egg prices."

Because of the combination of supply chain issues, post-pandemic inflation and lingering HPAI challenges, the price of eggs skyrocketed 70.7% in 2022. The price of eggs is expected to plummet in 2023 as grocery store prices begin to stabilize and the industry's challenges fade, bringing down revenue below pre-period levels."

While feed costs have risen, egg prices have outpaced feed cost and allowed for more breathing room in the industry's cost structure. Despite heavy volatility, egg production companies have been able to expand their profit over the past five years."

The stabilization of prices will help preserve demand from price-sensitive consumers, but the price of eggs won't return to 2022 and 2023 highs.
