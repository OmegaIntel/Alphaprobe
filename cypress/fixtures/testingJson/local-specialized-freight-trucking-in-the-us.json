Solid economic conditions increased spending on local specialized freight trucking in the years right before the pandemic, as high wages and consumer spending generated the need for specialized freight trucking from the retail, manufacturing and other relevant sectors. COVID-19 caused consumer spending, industrial production and fuel prices to sink, contributing to a significant drop in revenue in 2020. Recent economic disruptions have created new problems for the industry. The Federal Reserve has been raising interest rates in response to high inflation, inhibiting demand for construction, a sector that often local specialized freight trucking.",
