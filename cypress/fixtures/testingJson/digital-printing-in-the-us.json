Businesses have shifted more of their operations online as technology has improved digital data management. The proliferation of online media has urged companies to market themselves digitally, reducing their need for printed materials. On top of these trends, revenue plunged in 2020 as COVID-19 reduced corporate profit and encouraged more businesses to move operations online. The pandemic recovery caused corporate profit, business formation and paper prices to mount, resulting in a jump in revenue in 2022. Higher interest rates over the past couple of years have heightened recessionary fears, causing companies to tighten their belts and reduce their investment in the industry's services.
