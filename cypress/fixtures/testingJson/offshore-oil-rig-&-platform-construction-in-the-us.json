    "executive_summary": "Offshore oil rig and platform construction plays an important role in the United States' energy sector. Growing oil production caused industry revenue to increase at the beginning of the five-year period to 2023. Still, oil price weakness started shortly thereafter and weighed heavily on industry performance, resulting in revenue declines which persisted several years. Also, the COVID-19 pandemic caused all types of travel activity to slump, further lowering oil prices and hampering the purchasing power from upstream oil companies. Offshore oil rig and platform construction revenue has plummeted at a CAGR of 6.7% over the past five years and is expected to total $2.4 billion in 2023, when revenue will fall an estimated 12.8%. Profit will marginally increase as both the cost of labor and purchases drop.",

            "current_performance_point_description": "Through the end of 2023, revenue has fluctuated along with volatile crude oil prices. The world price of crude oil dropped amid the COVID-19 pandemic as complications significantly disrupted all types of economic activity. The world price of oil rebounded in 2021 as the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) curbed its production levels. This trend continued through 2022, causing industry revenue to grow for the year. Crude oil prices will once again drop in 2023, further constraining upstream demand and industry selling prices, further contributing to the overall decline in performance."

            "current_performance_point_description": "The onset of COVID-19 resulted in a sharp decline in both domestic and international travel activity, as countries across the world implemented travel restrictions and lockdown measures to slow the spread of the virus. Due to this, aggregate demand for oil fell abruptly and dramatically, which translated into a rapid fall in the world price of crude oil. This trend was aggravated by a price war between Saudi Arabia and Russia, as Saudi Arabia implemented a sharp oil price cut after Russia refused to agree to an OPEC demand to jointly cut oil production. Oil prices began to rapidly fall even further, causing demand for offshore oil rig and platform construction services significantly declined."

            "current_performance_point_description": "Hydraulic fracturing and directional drilling techniques spurred a boom in US energy production over the past five years. These techniques enabled upstream oil and gas producers to dramatically increase production of previously uneconomical resources. Due to this, the United States improved its position in the international energy market. Still, environmental concerns remained high alongside production capabilities, as the lingering memories of the Deepwater Horizon oil spill kept offshore drilling in the forefront of the environmental debate about oil and gas production."

            "current_performance_point_description": "Though prices were relatively high over the past five years, offshore oil and gas production is risky and expensive compared with onshore production. The construction process for offshore oil and gas rigs takes a long time, with many component parts manufactured abroad in Asia. Singapore, South Korea and China dominate the market for offshore oil and gas rigs, while the US industry is primarily focused on jack-up rigs, assembly, repair and maintenance services. This trend has been steady over the past five years, as the United States currently only has one active shipyard constructing offshore rigs in Brownsville, TX."

            "current_performance_point_description": "The industry is exposed to government decisions regarding offshore oil and gas drilling activity. Prior to the current period, then-President Obama lifted the moratorium on crude oil exports from the United States. In 2018, then-President Trump announced a proposal to open nearly all offshore waters to drilling. Still, this has endured intense opposition from both environmental groups and state governments in coastal states, such as Florida, North Carolina and California. The current administration announced a plan to roll back many of the safety regulations implemented in the aftermath of the Deepwater Horizon disaster. Due to this, oil and gas producers may expand their offshore operations moving forward in response to the prospect of a looser regulatory environment, which has the potential to boost industry revenue."

            "future_outlook_point_description": "Oil and gas production will continue expanding at a healthy pace over the next five years. This growth will largely be driven by onshore shale deposit extractions, but offshore activity will strengthen during the outlook period. As the end of COVID-19 quarantine measures and lockdown restrictions fuels a pent-up demand for travel and other economic activity, aggregate demand for oil will increase. Despite this, the world price of crude oil will endure sharp declines but will still remain higher than pre-pandemic levels. Even though oil prices are set to drop, the rate at which this will happen will be relatively subdued, enabling upstream companies to more effectively plan out future projects."

            "future_outlook_point_description": "Though production will remain robust, regulatory and environmental concerns have the potential to affect the industry over the next five years. Volatility in the price of oil and steel directly affects demand for offshore oil and gas rigs, as companies often plan the construction of offshore rigs and platforms years in advance of their potential use. Due to this, if the world price of oil declines significantly, companies in offshore oil rig and platform construction could encounter delayed and canceled projects. Still, demand should remain strong for offshore oil rig and platform construction services as existing oil and gas platforms and rigs continue to age. Also, oil is on pace to decline at a less volatile rate compared with the prior period."

Uncertainty surrounding the extent and timing of the economic recovery following the recession fueled by the COVID-19 pandemic may also adversely affect growth in industry revenue. Also, slowing growth from emerging markets and uncertainty about the future development of shale resources in Countries such as Russia and China could potentially dampen the industry's performance over the next five years."
