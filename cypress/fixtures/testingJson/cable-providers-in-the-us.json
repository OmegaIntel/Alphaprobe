        "During the pandemic, many consumers were pushed to use internet-based services and devices to be able to work from home, moving them away from cable providers and toward streaming services. This siphoning of demand has led to reduced revenue and reduced industry profitability.",
        "Cable providers have begun to rely on bundles and other price discounts to remedy the adverse effects of market penetration from streaming services. Prominent companies have taken advantage of these tumultuous times for the industry by acquiring smaller-scale enterprises.",
        "Industry revenue has been hindered as cable TV subscriptions have steadily declined since 2011. Despite this, recent inclines in the number of broadband connections and per capita disposable income, have supported industry demand.",
        "Consumer confidence was depleted in 2020 during the pandemic. This wane in spending made consumers more price-conscious and drove many toward more affordable streaming services instead of cable subscriptions, promoting cord-cutting.",
        "The industry has failed to capture the younger demographic market, as many consumers under 30 have never been subscribed to a cable provider and instead opt toward streaming. To offset this, older consumers over 65 have remained loyal to cable providers despite the emergence of cord-cutting.",
        "Premium channels have surged in popularity as demand for cable content shifts from quantity to quality. This growth has been tempered by many premium channels offering alternative streaming platforms.",

Still, suburban and rural subscription rates remain vital revenue sources for cable providers to continually develop service infrastructures.",

As overall demand decreased, companies experienced a decline in profitability. The upfront costs of establishing a cable network are significant; however, once the suitable infrastructure is in place, companies that can spread these fixed costs over a large subscriber base can generate a healthy profit. The industry has partially offset subscriber losses through price hikes."

            "question": "Cable Network",
            "answer": "Having an extensive distribution network. Owning and maintaining a well-developed, robust digital cable network enables companies to serve many households and businesses. Industry enterprises pay programming license fees to the cable networks carried and retransmission fees to TV broadcasters. Cable networks often have the upper hand in negotiating these fees. As cable networks have grown to operate more channels, these networks have had greater leverage over cable providers by selling them in bundles."

Cable providers deliver video, data, and voice services over the same infrastructure. Technological innovation in any of these fields affects the industry. For example, while the exponential rally in internet traffic has been the primary driver behind the implementation of fiber-to-the-premises networks, fiber-optic networks have also changed how cable providers operate and distribute programming."
