    "executive_summary": "Lotteries and Native American casinos are referring to gambling facilities, and do not include casino hotels or hotels that provide gambling services. Gambling and wagering represent luxury expenditures to most consumers, with the level of gambling primarily driven by the state of the economy. In periods of economic growth, lotteries and Native American casinos benefit from low unemployment levels, which drive growth in per capita disposable income. In contrast, recessionary periods cause the majority of consumers to opt against gambling in favor of reducing discretionary spending. Over the last few years, industry revenue grew at a CAGR of 5.5% to $198.9 billion, including an expected 3.3% rise in 2024.",
