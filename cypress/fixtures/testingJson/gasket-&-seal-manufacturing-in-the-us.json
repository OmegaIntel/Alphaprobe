    "executive_summary": "Through the end of 2023, gasket and seal manufacturers endured notable hardship, primarily due to the economic contraction brought on by COVID-19. Shutdowns across manufacturing sectors weakened demand for operators' products, in addition to the steep drop in demand for crude oil and natural gas hampering demand from extraction industries. Gasket and seal manufacturers are also highly globalized, so pandemic-related disruptions to supply chains hampered revenue as well. Growth in recent years as downstream industries recover, including an estimated boost of 2.3% in 2023 alone, has not been enough to offset these declines. These trends are expected to cause revenue to fall at a CAGR of 3.9% to an estimated $7.0 billion through the end of 2023.",

        },
        {
            "question": "Have exports offered an opportunity for your company?",
            "answer": "Yes, exports allow companies to serve fast-growing emerging markets. Retaliatory tariffs from import destinations threaten US exports."
        },
        {
            "question": "Has your company been exposed to volatile input prices over the past few years?",
            "answer": "Yes, COVID-19 led to a steep decline in many input costs, such as steel and rubber. Following the end of pandemic-related disruptions, these costs increased dramatically, hampering profit. Companies rely on rubber and metal commodities as primary inputs."
        },
        {
            "question": "Have you looked into setting up manufacturing facilities in lower-wage regions of the country?",
            "answer": "Yes, many of the largest players in this industry have operations abroad. Companies are more likely to open factories in Mexico given the country's proximity to the US and participation in the USMCA."
        },
        {
            "question": "Do you use SAP software systems to optimize all aspects of your company's manufacturing, sales, inventory and distribution channels?",
            "answer": "Companies are incentivized to use SAP software to improve the overall efficiency of operating large inventories. Given the variation in operators' products, most companies utilize some sort of inventory management software."
        },
        {
            "question": "Is your company investing in technology like 3D printing to establish a competitive edge?",
            "answer": "Few companies are investing in 3D printing due to its niche use for operators. 3D printing may be used for custom-made gaskets and seals."
        },
        {
            "question": "How have international tariffs impacted your ability to import and export products?",
            "answer": "High tariffs from import-destination countries will hinder the competitiveness of exports. Heightened trade tariffs have the potential to hamper industry revenue growth."
        },
        {
            "question": "Have any regulatory expenses significantly impacted profitability recently?",
            "answer": "No, regulatory expenses do not directly impact revenue to a significant degree. Regulation regarding the manufacturing sector is typically aligned with environmental regulations."
        },
        {
            "question": "How has input price volatility affected profit margins over the past 12 months?",
            "answer": "Input price volatility negatively affects profit margins. Companies hedge against volatility using derivatives to lock-in certain commodity prices."
        },
        {
            "question": "What ongoing financing challenges does your company face?",
            "answer": "A rising interest rate environment will make the cost of borrowing more expensive. As the cost of borrowing increases, companies are less likely to make long-term capital investments."
        },
        {
            "question": "Does the company provide after-sales advice to its customers? Does the company generate revenue through accessory sales?",
            "answer": "Manufacturers need to provide ongoing support for their machinery to retain customers."
        },
        {
            "question": "How do you attract and maintain relationships with suppliers? How can you diversify your connections?",
            "answer": "A diverse range of suppliers provides manufacturers with the ability to source a wider range of cost-effective inputs."
        },
        {
            "question": "Is your company dominant in any particular regional markets? What range does your company have in terms of viable operating area?",
            "answer": "Operators benefit from being in close proximity to regional hubs of industrial manufacturing activity."
        },
        {
            "question": "How is your company affected by the TWI? How is your business affected by imports?",
            "answer": "An increase in the value of the US dollar, reflected by an increasing TWI, makes domestic goods more expensive relative to imports. This supports import penetration and hurts domestic manufacturers, which include operators in this industry."
        },
        {
            "question": "How does the current number of new car sales affect your company? How can you adapt as new car sales decrease?",
            "answer": "Operators manufacture various types of automotive seals and gaskets such as head gaskets, coaxial seals, oil seals and O-rings. An increase in the number of car sales and the subsequent increase in the production of automobiles leads to greater demand for the industry's products."
        },
        {
            "question": "How much of your demand comes from manufacturers? Do you have contracts with a variety of downstream manufacturers?",
            "answer": "Industrial seals and gaskets are used in a variety of industrial processes and applications. A rising industrial production index translates to increased demand for industry products."
