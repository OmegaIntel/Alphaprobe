    "executive_summary": "The compounding pharmacy industry finds itself increasingly at the center of legal actions initiated by pharmaceutical manufacturers. These lawsuits primarily focus on intellectual property violations, where manufacturers accuse compounding pharmacies of stepping beyond their regulatory boundaries by reproducing commercially available drugs. This uptick in litigation corresponds with the rise in compounding practices over the last five years despite the stricter regulatory framework under Section 503A of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, which stipulates the conditions under which compounded drugs do not require FDA approval. Despite the ongoing legal challenges, compounding pharmacies have embraced e-commerce to extend their reach beyond conventional geographic limitations. This shift has been catalyzed by the broader trend towards online healthcare.",
