    "executive_summary": "The Discount Department Stores industry has faced several disruptive trends in the last few years, notably surging competition both externally and internally. Online retailers and e-commerce giants like Amazon have emerged as formidable external competitors, leveraging the increasing convenience and comfort of online shopping. Simultaneously, competition within the industry has intensified, with aggressive pricing strategies, frequent promotions and the constant effort to enhance the in-store experience becoming crucial for differentiation. Overall, industry revenue is expected to have decreased at a CAGR of 2.2% to $102.1 billion in the current period, including an estimated drop of 2.3% in 2024 alone.",
