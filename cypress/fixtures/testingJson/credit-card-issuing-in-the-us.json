Commercial banks are excluded from this industry since credit card issuance is not a primary business activity. Industry operators generate revenue from cardholders primarily through fees and interest earned on revolving credit. Companies compete by offering customers lower interest rates, flexible and secure payment options and rewards programs based on spending levels.",
