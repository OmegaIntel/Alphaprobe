    "executive_summary": "The Aircraft Parts Distributors industry's performance aligns closely with the economy. The pandemic significantly impeded the industry in 2020 by halting air travel. However, when the economy began to recover, air travel experienced growth as people resumed flying after a year of holding back. This uptick led to aircraft returning to service, relying on distributors for parts and supplies to ensure safety and meet industry standards. Nonetheless, the Federal Reserve's decision to significantly hike interest rates multiple times during 2022 and early 2023 has led to a tighter economic policy. This change has affected budgets and decreased disposable income rates, causing some instability in the industry.",

In 2023, multiple interest rate hikes early in the year caused a travel slowdown as consumers scaled back. Many people have chosen to conserve funds and closely monitor their spending. Even so, at the last two Federal Reserve meetings in September and November 2023, the Fed decided to keep rates as they are."

However, introducing newer aircraft models has rendered these older parts incompatible. The market's surplus of old aircraft parts has led to a price drop. This excessive supply impedes sales, as many aircraft owners have opted to purchase new aircraft."

Integration with OEM allows companies to leverage bulk purchasing, lower production costs, streamline operations and achieve economies of scale, ultimately reducing overall purchasing expenses. It also gives some distributors access to products that may not be available elsewhere."
