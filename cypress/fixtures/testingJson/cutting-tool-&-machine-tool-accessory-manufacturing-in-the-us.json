Industry-wide revenue fell at a CAGR of 0.6% to $6.5 billion over the past five years, including a 1.5% decrease in 2023.",

Growing demand for cutting tool and machine tool accessories will be derived from rising nonresidential building activity. Despite this growth, lower operational costs in countries such as China and Mexico will continue to prompt operators to use offshore facilities, reducing domestic companies' ability to keep up with foreign competition. Industry revenue will nonetheless fall at a CAGR of 0.1% to $6.5 billion over the next five years."
