    "executive_summary": "Ornamental and architectural metalwork manufacturers develop architectural metalwork, including fences, handrails, balcony rails, screen doors, window guards and other architectural fittings. Over the past five years, the industry expanded with domestic construction. Favorable economic conditions have encouraged nonresidential and residential construction activity. In particular, low interest rates have facilitated investment as the low cost of borrowing bolstered the potential profitability. Still, these trends were derailed by the economic effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. Also, volatile steel and aluminum prices have hindered industry selling prices, further constraining revenue.",

            "current_performance_point_description": "The price of metals and import penetration heavily influence the industry's performance. Steel and aluminum represent key inputs in the manufacturing process of ornamental and architectural metalwork products. Although rising metal prices increase purchase costs for manufacturers, they also boost the value of inventory and raise selling prices as increased prices are passed down to the customer. Conversely, low steel prices indicate periods of excess supply, weak demand and devalued inventory. Domestic manufacturers have struggled to secure stable purchasing contracts while contending with intense low-cost import competition from Chinese producers."

Import competition will decrease compared with the prior period based on current steel tariffs remaining in place and a depreciation of the US dollar. This expected decline will prove advantageous for domestic manufacturers as low-cost steel imports, particularly from China, are inhibited by an additional 25.0% tariff."

Domestic manufacturers will benefit from relatively strong international demand for higher-quality metalwork products. A depreciating US dollar will spur demand and make domestically produced goods more attractive to overseas buyers. Despite a beneficial drop in the US dollar, exports will continue accounting for a minority share of industry revenue."
