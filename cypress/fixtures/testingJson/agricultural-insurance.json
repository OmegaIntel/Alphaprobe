            "question": "What is the industry assistance for the Agricultural Insurance industry?",
            "answer": "The Agricultural Insurance industry is heavily subsidized. Approved Insurance Providers (AIPs) enter into a Standard Reinsurance Agreement (SRA) with the Federal Crop Insurance Corporation (FCIC), where the FCIC shares a portion of the AIP's underwriting losses. The US Department of Agriculture (USDA)'s Risk Management Agency (RMA) also reimburses private insurance companies for some operating and administrative costs, accounting for over 60.0% of total premiums in 2021."

        {
            "question": "How did the Coronavirus Food Assistance Program (CFAP) support the industry?",
            "answer": "The Coronavirus Food Assistance Program (CFAP) provided support to agricultural suppliers and insurers by alleviating revenue declines due to reduced demand and supply chain disruptions. It helped insurers weather the COVID-19 storm and will likely allow premiums to increase significantly in 2021, boosting industry revenue. Fiscal and monetary stimulus also provided a financial cushion for consumers, boosting agriculture revenue in 2021."

            "question": "How does the industry earn revenue despite restrictive legislation?",
            "answer": "Agricultural insurers are able to earn revenue regardless of the regulatory environment due to the strong underlying demand from farmers due to unpredictable weather."
        },
        {
            "question": "How has cost volatility affected profit margins?",
            "answer": "Natural disasters lead to large claims costs for the industry. Because these events are unpredictable and vary year-to-year, industry profit fluctuates year to year."

        {
            "question": "How does the agricultural price index influence the industry?",
            "answer": "The agricultural price index represents nominal prices received by farmers for all US agricultural products. When crop prices decrease, so do premiums garnered by industry operators because their policies depend on the value of crops."

            "question": "How does government investment assist the industry?",
            "answer": "The Agricultural Insurance industry is heavily subsidized by the US government due to the large systemic effects of agricultural losses.
