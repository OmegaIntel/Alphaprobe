    "executive_summary": "Figures have been adjusted for inflation and are presented in 2023 currency.\n\nThe Organic Chemical Pipeline Transportation industry transports various industrial and organic chemicals via pipeline. Revenue is dictated by pipeline throughput and fees charged to customers for transportation services. Carbon dioxide (CO2) transportation is the industry's largest service segment; it is commonly used to enhance well flow in oilfields. The use of natural gas accounts for more than 60.0% of all enhanced oil recovery production (EOR) in the United States. Industry services are also required to transport various chemicals to many other industrial producers; however, energy markets have an unequivocal influence on the industry. Revenue has declined although US energy production soared and oilfields required more CO2 for EOR, it was subdued by uninspired energy prices. Demand from energy producers and most other industrial companies has also been hampered by the global economic lockdown in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.",

However, booming oil production has spurred new entrants into the industry to satisfy climbing CO2 demand for use as an EOR method. New entrants and existing companies have also been aided by the improving level of access to credit as this industry is highly capital-intensive."
