    "executive_summary": "Figures have been adjusted for inflation and are presented in 2024 currency.\n\nOnline photo printing companies have had to compete with the growing popularity of digital photo sharing. Social networks and other photo-sharing sites encouraged an expanding number of consumers to store and print pictures through online channels. The number of broadband and mobile internet connections has increased in recent years. Online photo printing companies have been grappling with increased input costs, primarily driven by rising paper prices spurred by tighter environmental regulations and reduced logging activities. As a result, companies have had to hike their prices to balance these additional expenses, limiting consumer demand for photo printing. Revenue has fallen at a CAGR of 3.0% to reach $4.3 billion in 2024, including a 1.6% contraction in 2024.\n\nWages have accounted for a growing share of industry revenue in recent years as photo printers compete for highly skilled labor, including computer programmers; wage growth has contributed to falling profit. Innovation has made customization more fun and accessible for consumers. This trend has enabled companies to offer a broader spectrum of products in pursuit of customer loyalty and competitive advantage through solid brand recognition.\n\nMoving forward, technological advancements will continue to stimulate industry expansion. As economic conditions improve, consumers will engage more in discretionary spending, including traditional photo printing. Continuous advancements in smartphone camera technology will also be.",
