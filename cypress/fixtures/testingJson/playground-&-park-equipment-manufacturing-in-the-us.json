    "executive_summary": "State and local government budgets drive demand for playground and park equipment since recreation budgets typically fund these projects. Nonetheless, government budgets took a hit from COVID-19. During the pandemic, budgets shifted to focus on providing aid for hospitals and essential workers, reducing expenditure on recreation. Nonetheless, nonprofits funding playground equipment construction has fueled some growth for manufacturers. During this time, private spending on home improvements, which includes the installation of playground equipment, rose as children couldn't use public playgrounds to prevent the spread of the virus, supporting demand for manufacturers in 2021 and helping offset pandemic-related losses. These trends led to revenue falling at an estimated CAGR of 1.0% to $984.2 million through 2024, including a 6.6% dip that year alone.",

These producers often have a significant price advantage that enables them to charge lower prices and appeal to price-conscious buyers, a trend enhanced by the recent appreciation of the dollar. Similarly, volatile commodity prices have greatly impacted manufacturers. The price of steel, a major input in equipment production, has endured drastic price fluctuations amid changes in downstream demand and supply chain disruptions. Surging steel prices have increased input costs and hindered profit growth as companies can only raise prices so much since they must keep prices competitive with low-cost foreign manufacturers."

During the COVID-19 pandemic, most public funding was allocated toward healthcare, social services and businesses to weaken the effect of the virus, harming demand for new parks and playgrounds. Manufacturers benefited from higher funding from non-profit organizations that aimed to support children's exercise. This funding helped offset some losses from government investment, although it fell short of fully offsetting pandemic-related losses. Manufacturers benefited from revenue gains as the economy reopened and economic conditions improved. However, heightened consumer uncertainty and significant inflationary pressures have contributed to revenue losses."

Supply chain disruptions in recent years have contributed to input price volatility through fluctuations in the price of steel and plastic. Rising operating expenses make domestic producers less competitive globally. Heightened inflationary pressure since 2022 has made buyers more price-conscious. Significant price-based competition prevents domestic producers from passing down cost increases to downstream buyers. Because of this, the average manufacturer has had to cover higher purchase costs, harming profit."

During this time, new park and playground equipment wasn't a priority for many schools and families, contributing to weaker trade activity. Various international conflicts, including the Ukraine-Russia war and the ongoing conflict in the Middle East, have contributed to global instability and have led to an appreciating US dollar. A strong dollar negatively impacts domestic producers by making imports comparatively more affordable to domestic buyers, resulting in significant import penetration. Since playgrounds and parks are generally not considered necessities, domestic and foreign buyers have postponed these purchases, resulting in shrinking trade activity and harming domestic producers."

Schools with low budgets are less likely to upgrade equipment. Government funding for primary and secondary education has been rising in recent years. However, many of these gains were put toward the adoption and deployment of technologies that facilitated remote learning, deprioritizing funding for parks and playgrounds.
