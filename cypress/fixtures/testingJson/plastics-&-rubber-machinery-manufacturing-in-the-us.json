Revenue for the car manufacturing industry (IBISWorld report 33611a) has decreased over much of the past five years due to declining car sales and shifting consumer preferences. The automotive industry is still struggling to recover from the downturns of the pandemic as consumer preferences have shifted due in large part to the recent increases in remote work."

Supply chain efficiencies, lower wage costs and fewer regulations have enabled manufacturers in foreign countries to produce machinery at lower prices than their US counterparts. In turn, these savings are passed on to the consumer in the form of lower prices, siphoning revenue away from domestic manufacturers."

While robust residential construction has characterized most of the current period, the drastic reversal of nonresidential construction activity during the COVID-19 pandemic temporarily offset these gains. Nonresidential construction activity is expected to rise in 2024 as investment in different commercial and industrial structures continues."

The world price of oil rebounded in 2021 as the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) curbed its production levels.

Domestic plastics and rubber machinery manufacturers will benefit from relatively strong international demand for higher quality components. A depreciating US dollar would spur demand, as a weaker dollar can make domestically produced goods more attractive to overseas buyers. Still, low-cost imports will continue to remain competitive and constrain industry revenue."

As commercial construction activity improves, demand for plastic pipes used in plumbing will grow. The key segments of the nonresidential construction market include office and commercial space expansion, which will be lifted by restored business sentiment, in addition to hospital and educational building construction, supported by expanding government budgets. Strong corporate profit, along with a rebound in macroeconomic conditions, will boost aggregate commercial spending and private construction."
