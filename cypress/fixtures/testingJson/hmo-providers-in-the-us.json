In recent years, HMOs (health maintenance organizations) have consistently lost ground in the provision of employer-based coverage. However, this overall decline had been outweighed by growth in the overall number of people with insurance. Prior to 2020, private insurance enrollment had been on the rise, but in 2020, COVID-19 caused insurance enrollment to fall due to heightened unemployment. However, as the pandemic begins to pass, unemployment is expected to fall, causing revenue to grow an estimated 4.4% in 2023 alone.",
