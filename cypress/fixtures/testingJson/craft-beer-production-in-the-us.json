However, the once-booming industry has reached a tipping point over the past decade, as oversaturation and the emergence of many substitutes have stalled revenue growth. The pandemic coincided with craft brewery's growth approaching normalization, resulting in a period of drastic volatility. Unlike some of its external competitors, craft breweries struggled to maintain consistent growth in the pandemic's wake. Thus, revenue has been sinking at a CAGR of 3.8% over the past five years and is estimated to fall 1.9% in 2024 alone, when revenue will reach $7.2 billion.",

The pandemic and subsequent social-distancing measures, along with nonessential business closures, resulted in drastic disruptions for most craft brewers, as many rely on in-person sales and events to generate sales and spread word-of-mouth recommendations. Though revenue began rebounding as vaccines became widely available, the unprecedented circumstances caused shifts in consumer preferences and drinking habits, forcing many craft brewers to contend with a changed landscape."

While new craft brewers popped up at much greater rates in decades prior, more than 2,000 new craft breweries have opened since 2019, intensifying competition in an already crowded space."

Many craft brewers lack the means to effectively export products, due to the small production level requirements to be distinguished as a craft brewery, so exports account for a small share of revenue. Moving forward, craft breweries will manage a return to growth, capitalizing on emerging markets, but the explosive expansion once common to the industry is unlikely to return."

However, in the coming years, as more craft breweries reach maturity and a crowded landscape renders organic growth difficult, M&A activity is likely to rise. Craft breweries operate in a unique environment: A craft brewery must produce less than 6.0 million barrels of beer each year, so growing too large results in the brewery losing its craft distinction, forcing owners to weigh the benefits of increasing production."
