    "executive_summary": "The Baby Food Manufacturing industry produces various forms of baby food and has encountered growth over the past five years. However, in 2021, following the pandemic, the industry encountered supply chain disruptions. Supply chain disruptions impacted the industry's supply and distribution channels. These disruptions caused inefficient manufacturing processes for operators and led manufacturers to exit the industry, resulting in industry establishment declines. However, a jump in per capita disposable income and consumer spending over the past five years has boosted industry demand and revenue. Over the past five years, revenue has climbed at a CAGR of 2.4% to $4.2 billion, including an expected increase of 4.6% in 2024. Profit is expected to climb slightly and account for 1.8% of revenue in 2024 from 1.7% in 2019.",
