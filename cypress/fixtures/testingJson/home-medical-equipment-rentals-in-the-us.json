Key among these trends is the aging population's growing preference for aging in place, bolstered by tech advances and healthcare delivery models. Older adults opt to stay in their homes longer, driving demand for HME that supports independent living and healthcare management at home. At the same time, the rapid expansion of telehealth following the COVID-19 pandemic is reshaping the landscape of HME rentals.",

A healthy demand for home medical equipment (HME) rental was accelerated by the pandemic and its influence on the adoption of telehealth and home-based care solutions. Patients, particularly those at higher risk or recovering from illness, preferred to recuperate in familiar environments, spurring demand for HME like hospital beds, oxygen concentrators and monitoring devices."

Supply chain disruptions are creating manufacturing delays, shortages of raw materials and transportation issues that impact their ability to fulfill orders promptly, weakening revenue growth in 2022. Inflationary trends have also impacted operating costs. Fluctuating costs for inventory transportation and labor have increased rental prices, constraining profit growth despite the high demand for home medical equipment rentals. Steep pent-up demand for discretionary medical procedures and a growing preference to receive care at home allowed the majority of HME rental providers to balance the pressure of supply chain disruptions and inflation."

With an aging population, there's a growing trend towards \"aging in place.\" Seniors prefer to remain in their homes rather than move to assisted living facilities. This trend drives demand for HME that supports independent living and healthcare management at home.
