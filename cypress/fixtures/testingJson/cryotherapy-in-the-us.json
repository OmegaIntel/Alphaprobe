    "executive_summary": "Companies in the cryotherapy industry serve a range of downstream markets. The two largest are private and government funded healthcare markets. During the period, an influx of funding for Medicaid and Medicare bolstered downstream demand from the government market, as growing funding pushed more consumers to cryotherapy companies. Opposing this growth was a stagnation in the number of people on private health insurance plans during the same period. This stagnation was partially caused by an increasing average cost of private insurance. For out-of-pocket patients, disposable income is a lead indicator for demand. Throughout the period increasing per capita income led to growth of the market, however, increasing interest rates in 2022 led to a large decrease in disposable income, limiting the growth of the downstream segment slightly.",
