As digitalization accelerates, data centers have evolved from simple infrastructure to essential strategic assets. These hubs now power services ranging from cloud computing to advanced data analytics. In 2024, the global data center market, including giants like Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud Platform (GCP), achieved a substantial revenue of $343.1 billion, following a strong compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 8.9% since 2019.",

Leading industry players International Business Machines Corporation (IBM) and Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company (HPE) have both heavily integrated cloud computing into the corporate data processing and hosting services they offer. As a result, this segment has faced tremendous revenue growth over the past five years."

But non-industry providers led by Amazon's AWS, Google's Cloud and Microsoft's Azure swallow many less technical clients."

Due to lower overseas labor costs, international companies are able to offer data processing and hosting services at a lower price, increasing competition for industry contracts. Recently, the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) demanded that US companies servicing clients in the EU store EU citizens' data locally without prior approval."

Meanwhile, data centers thrived more than ever as nearly a fifth of all economic activity was conducted online. The COVID economic shock accelerated revenue growth in 2020 despite many client businesses failing to expand into higher-end data center solutions. As companies have remained bullish on digital technology, revenue grew more vigorously in 2021 and 2022."

Their recent launches focus on computing closer to data generation sources and collaborating between on-device and in-cloud computation. Artificial intelligence-powered Large Language Models are currently the most compute-heavy task in data centers. Their power and water needs are often so extreme that companies are hyperscaling at a loss, trying to find more efficient computation methods instead of charging customers the actual price of the services."
