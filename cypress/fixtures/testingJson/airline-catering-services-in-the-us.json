    "executive_summary": "As COVID-19 shaped global travel, the airline catering industry has seen a significant hit, causing a decline in revenue. The industry's revenue is projected to decrease an annualized 9.4% to $3.6 billion over the five years to 2024. US-based travelers, for example, have reduced their international travels amid the pandemic, turning towards domestic journeys instead, albeit marginally. The repercussions of the global health crisis have also seen a massive reduction in demand for air catering services as travel rates declined dramatically. Furthermore, the surge in the world price of crude oil has only exacerbated the industry's challenges, creating a relatively harsh business environment.",

            "current_performance_point_description": "Over recent years, fierce competition in the airline industry has caused companies to focus more on beating their rivals' pricing rather than differentiating themselves with onboard services. This price-centric strategy has eroded some of the traditional sources of income for airlines. As oil prices soared in the mid-2000s, airlines were forced to rethink their approach. One measure taken was to reduce costs by eliminating meals for economy-class passengers on nearly all domestic flights in the United States. This decision affected the revenue stream previously generated from meals. Based on the current outlook, the future performance and revenue growth of the airline catering services industry will depend on how airlines balance their need to control costs with evolving consumer demands. Airlines may need to explore creative solutions, such as partnerships with food delivery."

Airlines increasingly recognize the importance of offering healthy, fresh, locally sourced in-flight meal options to differentiate their service and appeal to a broader group of passengers. Alongside this, there's also a growing emphasis on sustainability, with airlines and their catering providers exploring ways to reduce food waste, utilize eco-friendly packaging, and even consider plant-based meal options."

            "current_performance_point_description": "Due to increasing competition, airlines now consider quality food options a determining factor in determining their differentiation from their rivals. This demand for improved food options has forced catering services in the airline industry to innovate and evolve. Domestic airlines are seeking to improve their image and bounce back from financial mishaps by emulating the international services provided by their foreign competitors. This desire for improvement fuels innovations in the catering department. Catering services now associate themselves with renowned chefs and hotel chains, aiming to leverage their reputation. For example, Deutsche Lufthansa AG has partnered with chefs from the Mandarin Oriental hotel chain, and Delta has enlisted a celebrity chef from Napa Valley to revamp their menus. Such partnerships pair airlines with prominent establishments in the food and hospitality industry, thus offering the potential to improve the overall flight experience for passengers. This, in turn, has the potential to attract more passengers, boost profits and allow carriers to remain competitive in the ever-intensifying airline industry."

Today's technology allows for a more customized experience than ever, and airlines are looking to harness this to better cater to passengers' dietary needs and preferences. Expect to see advanced digital platforms where passengers can tailor their meals well before their flight. Choices for dietary restrictions, allergies, cultural preferences, and even specific diets like keto or vegan may become common. Thus, this type of service could significantly enhance passenger satisfaction and loyalty."

The sector has embraced new developments, such as introducing high-tech, lightweight catering trolleys. This new generation of trolleys has significantly reduced the carrying weight for flights, a direct contributor to decreasing fuel consumption. This has not only presented a viable solution to managing costs but has also paved the way for a more environmentally sustainable approach. The industry's cost cutting measures are not limited to the skies. Catering facilities have also evolved, where food is prepared before being shipped to airports. The specifics of these changes, though undisclosed, are characterized by the synchronization of technology and operation, considerably adding to the industry's overall cost-saving strategy."

They're partnering with Beyond Meat and Impossible Foods, renowned Silicon Valley-based food tech companies, to offer plant-based burgers on their in-flight menus. Pre-ordered meals are gaining popularity in the industry. Airlines allow customers to make meal choices beforehand, which could significantly curb food waste. Catering service providers can also efficiently plan their ingredient purchases, further streamlining their operations. In response to increased demand for healthy food, airlines have provided more fruits, veggies, lean proteins, and whole grains. Some airlines may even start providing calorie counts and nutritional information for their meals in response to consumer demand for transparency."
