This growth is a result of consistent increases in healthcare expenditure and medical cost inflation, in addition to a decline in the uninsured rate. Industry revenue is correlated with total health expenditure, as operators increase premiums to maintain profitability. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the industry experienced an influx of enrollment through expanded Medicaid eligibility, in addition to lower operating costs due to lower healthcare utilization.",
