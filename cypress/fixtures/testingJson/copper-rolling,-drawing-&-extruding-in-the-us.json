    "executive_summary": "The copper rolling, drawing and extruding industry sells copper products in varying volumes based on the global price of copper, with revenue generally moving in line with its market price. Optimistic economic conditions caused revenue to grow as residential construction activity and the electrical transmission market expanded. High inflation and higher interest rates have since cooled residential building markets. The nonresidential construction market has struggled to bounce back from pandemic-related losses. However, serving various markets protects copper processors from adverse changes in demand. Revenue is expected to grow at a CAGR of 4.8% to $34.0 billion through the end of 2024, with a 1.5% decline forecast during the current year.",

Russia's invasion of Ukraine led to higher prices, as the country is a major copper supplier. Lower copper supply at a global level led to supply chain disruptions, raising copper prices. Copper prices peaked in 2022. During this period, demand for manufactured products was high, enabling copper companies to pass down costs to consumers and supporting industry performance."

A strong dollar also makes imports more affordable for domestic consumers, encouraging buyers to buy copper from foreign companies. There is a high demand for copper products from various industries. Companies aiming to reduce purchase costs will be more inclined to import these inputs. The global demand for US copper products spiked in 2021, resulting in higher exports. However, this trend reversed quickly due to growing economic uncertainty, harming domestic producers."

            "question": "Does your company participate in trade? When the value of the US dollar is high, how does your company mitigate the threat of low-cost exports?",
            "answer": "As the value of the dollar falls, it bolsters the purchasing power of foreign buyers of industry products while resulting in higher relative import prices. When the trade-weighted index increases, import competition increases and industry exports are less competitive in the global market."
