Microsoft Word and Excel have enabled executives and schoolchildren to command words and numbers easily. The industry has been richly rewarded for these world-changing applications, with revenue climbing at a CAGR of 6.9% to $160.4 billion in 2023, with profit reaching 15.8% and revenue rising 2.1% in 2023 alone.",

European regulators continue striking at the tech giants with privacy and antimonopoly legislation, causing significant internal bleeding. Cyberattacks and global conflicts are also poking holes in the digital global market rapidly. Open-source, free software, led by Linux, has finally become a viable option for technical home users. With the size and necessity of digital productivity tools, the operating system and productivity software developers will not lose revenue. Still, growth will slow, rising at a CAGR of 0.9% to $168.2 billion from 2023 to 2028."

        "Large companies creating software are technologically-diversified megaliths, integrating operating systems and productivity with numerous income streams. These companies almost always elect to release operating systems for free, knowing that increased revenue on other products and data collection will more than make up the loss.",
        "Regulators have begun restricting the largest operating system and productivity software developers, citing anticompetitive practices, disregard for the environment and personal privacy violations. The European Union and California have taken the lead on this movement, though the Biden administration's word on the subject will carry the most weight for Microsoft, Apple and Google.",
        "Diverse computing in every corner of the home, office and factory is providing opportunities for established and existing players alike. Traditional operating systems are highly wasteful on these embedded devices, so the industry is refocusing on power efficiency and quiet operation more than sheer performance.",

        "Freelancer and individual purchases spiked massively during the pandemic, clawing back license seats from folding businesses and offices. Business ownership of software used at home is becoming the norm, though.",
        "The pandemic has made offices almost irrelevant to most software developers. Technology companies have always been lenient when offering employees remote work packages, and very few require in-person attendance to this day.",
