    "executive_summary": "Figures have been adjusted for inflation and are presented in 2024 currency. The Port & Harbor Operations faced a dynamic landscape driven by shifting economic conditions, technological advancements and evolving trade patterns. The Federal Reserve's fight to curb inflation led to higher interest rates, making it more expensive to finance debt and impeding the expansion efforts of ports. Consumer sentiment and spending were key revenue drivers for ports, which handle approximately 90.0% of global goods shipments. The surge in e-commerce sales during 2020 and 2021 bolstered revenues for port operators, while elevated interest rates dampened consumer spending, particularly in 2023. This decline caused shipping volumes at larger ports to plummet, although dry land ports remained a bright spot because of the distribution of domestically produced goods. Trade dynamics have also been volatile, with the strong US dollar hurting exports and boosting imports. Revenue has been increasing at a CAGR of 4.8% over the past five years, and is expected to reach $5.5 billion in 2024.",
