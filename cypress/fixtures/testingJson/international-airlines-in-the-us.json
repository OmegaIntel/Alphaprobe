Before the pandemic, mounting competition from foreign competitors and chronic overcapacity within the industry's cargo transportation segment forced airlines to slash ticket prices and reduce freight shipping rates, causing revenue to weaken. The pandemic generated the most substantial revenue decline in industry history, including significant losses in profit. The ongoing economic recovery and pent-up consumer demand for experiences led to a rapid recovery.",
