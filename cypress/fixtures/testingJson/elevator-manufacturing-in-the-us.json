    "executive_summary": "The Elevator Manufacturing industry is composed of companies that produce elevator cars, hoisting systems and escalators for commercial, residential and industrial buildings. Demand for this industry is largely based on trends in the Construction sector, as buildings with multiple floors typically need elevators to move people and equipment between floors quickly and safely. The COVID-19 pandemic resulted in a weakened construction sector, as work-from-home capabilities and growing economic uncertainty reduced demand for new construction projects. More recently, elevated interest rates have constrained investment into construction, while manufacturing construction has benefitted from federal policies. Ultimately, revenue is set to have fallen at a five year CAGR of 0.9% to reach $4.2 billion through the end of 2024, including an expected 0.3% increase in 2024 alone.",

During the initial stages of the pandemic, construction and manufacturing activity faced significant slowdowns as consumer uncertainty rose. The growing popularity of work-from-home trends harmed new nonresidential construction, as many companies resorted to downsizing their office spaces. Rising interest rates, stubborn inflation and swelling economic uncertainty prevent construction activity from recovering, harming elevator manufacturers."

The price of steel, a main input in elevator production, has endured significant volatility over recent years, as a pandemic-induced slowdown in manufacturing activity caused a significant drop in demand for steel. As the economy began to bounce back, steel prices skyrocketed. Higher steel prices and growing demand from the residential sector led to a jump in"
