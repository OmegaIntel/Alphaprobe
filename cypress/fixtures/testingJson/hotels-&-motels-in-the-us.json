The COVID-19 pandemic's travel restrictions mostly paused travel activity for an extended period of time, causing hotels and motels to be one of the industries hit the hardest in 2020. The lifting of those travel restrictions resulted in skyrocketing hotel revenue in subsequent years but rising inflation pushed some consumers to reduce spending on leisure activities, causing revenue growth to slow down.",
