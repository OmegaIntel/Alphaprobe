            "question": "How have economic changes influenced consumer demand for your services?",
            "answer": "Industry operators tend to experience higher demand during periods of economic growth. Since estate planning is something people already tend to put off, they are more likely to do so during periods of lower disposable income or unemployment. However, amid the coronavirus pandemic, and despite the recession in 2020, industry revenue increased due to an increase in the number of deaths and greater demand for industry services."
        },
        {
            "question": "What is your company's most significant operational expense?",
