    "executive_summary": "Since 2019, the United States has emerged as a leading crude oil producer, surpassing giants like Saudi Arabia and Russia. The surge in domestic oil production, driven by fracking and other unconventional drilling techniques, has significantly increased demand for oil pipelines to transport crude oil to refineries nationwide. Geopolitical tensions, including the war in Ukraine, have further influenced oil prices, causing volatility and necessitating rapid adjustments in oil transportation and production. Technological advancements led to skyrocketing productivity, compensating for rig closures. Environmental regulations and protests played a significant role, culminating in the abandonment of the Keystone XL pipeline project in 2021. The oil pipeline transportation industry's revenue has been declining by a CAGR of 2.4% to $15.9 billion over the five years through 2024, including an expected 0.5% uptick in 2024 alone.",
