While both exports and imports have been volatile during the period, with both plummeting in 2020 amid the coronavirus pandemic, exports have consistently fallen from their 2017 high. An inflated US dollar during most of the period contributed to the decline in exports. Conversely, imports have increased, outpacing growth in industry demand and thus increasing their share of domestic demand during the period."

Demand for top-load washing machines primarily depends on multifamily residential construction and rental occupancy rates, as these products are commonly installed in apartment buildings and other similar structures. Laundromats favor top-load washers over frontload varieties because they are smaller and less expensive to purchase.

Frontload washing machines typically cost more than top-load washers, but they boast the advantage of long-term energy and water savings. Since a front load washing machine uses gravity, it can submerge nearly the same amount of clothes as a top-load washer in one-third of the water. Frontload washing machines tend to be more durable than top-load machines. The accepted standard useful life of the Whirlpool Corporation's frontload washers is 10 to 15 years, compared with a useful life of between five and eight years for their top-load washers.
