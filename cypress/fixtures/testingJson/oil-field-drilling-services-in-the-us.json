    "executive_summary": "Figures have been adjusted for inflation and are presented in 2023 currency. The industry provides support services on a fee or contract basis to companies involved in oil extraction, mining and quarrying. Since the extraction of hydrocarbons dwarves that of any other mineral or energy source in the United States, most oil field drilling service companies are concerned with providing support services strictly to oil companies. Due to this relationship, the industry is exposed to numerous endogenous and exogenous factors that factor into the success of the Oil Drilling and Gas Extraction industry (IBISWorld report 21111). For example, rising hydrocarbon prices often yield an increase in demand for oil field drilling services as previously unprofitable sites become attractive to producers. Still, as prices dip, demand for oil field drilling services may recede as producers become more cautious regarding extracting resources in a low-priced environment and limit drilling to only the most profitable fields. Industry revenue has plummeted at a CAGR of 7.8% over the past five years and is expected to total $51.1 billion in 2023, when revenue will fall by an estimated 10.2%.",

            "current_performance_point_description": "Companies in the industry provide valuable services to upstream oil companies and sell products that oil field oil field drilling service companies use to explore and develop oil deposits. Similar to upstream oil companies, oil field drilling service companies are highly exposed to fluctuations in crude oil prices, which can be affected by various factors. Demand for oil field drilling services initially benefited over the five years to 2023 as the prices of crude oil increased from decade lows and spurred new drilling activity. Still, revenue gains quickly sputtered out upon the emergence of global socioeconomic restrictions that were implemented to curb the spread of the virus. Ultimately, this led to a collapse in oil demand. Lower crude oil prices and constricted global supply lines have led to lower drilling activity for oil field drilling service companies. Industry profit will decrease due to volatile demand and rising purchase costs."

            "current_performance_point_description": "The largest companies in the industry benefit from economies of scale and greater experience working on a wide variety of projects, giving them an advantage over smaller oil field drilling service companies. Although the emergence of hydraulic fracturing, commonly known as fracking and horizontal drilling techniques have spurred higher levels of production and investment in recent years, the industry has also encountered substantial setbacks in the five-year period. Despite exorbitant revenue volatility, there are still plenty opportunities for new businesses to enter the market over the five years to 2023, primarily very small or nonemploying companies. Currently, nonemploying operations are to account for more than half of all companies in the industry. Still, the COVID-19 pandemic led to a substantial decline in industry participation, as many oil field drilling service companies have been forced to leave the industry amid heightened restrictions and economy uncertainty."

The emergence of hydraulic fracturing and horizontal drilling has been a boon to upstream oil producers and these techniques will continue to sustain demand for oil field drilling services over the next five years. Still, environmental concerns persist moving forward and due to this, tighter regulations will emerge concerning unconventional oil extraction techniques. Also, in accordance with the Biden Administration, regulatory concerns have become more pronounced and the regulatory burden may continue to increase on oil field drilling service companies in the outlook period. Nonetheless, the industry is poised to benefit from growing production levels of domestic oil."

Over the next five years, the world price of crude oil will fall, resulting in anticipated reduction in revenue generation. Oil field drilling service companies will make cutbacks on employment due to an anticipated recession. Both industry wages and employment will decrease over the five years to 2028. Also, many states have implemented fracking regulations over the five years to 2023 and this trend will continue in the outlook period. The federal government and Environmental Protection Agency will also likely implement more stringent regulations for fracking and oil emissions. In particular, oil field drilling service companies will be required to use pollution-capture technology, further raising costs. Growing regulations will increase operating costs, preventing large profit gains."
