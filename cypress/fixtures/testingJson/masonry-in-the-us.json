    "executive_summary": "Masonry contractors have faced declines over the current period. Contractors have faced various headwinds, including higher costs relative to other construction methods and labor shortages. Slower construction spending has led to greater price-based competition among contractors, hindering profit growth. Also, labor shortages have increased wage costs as contractors look to hike wages to attract and retain skilled workers, putting downward pressure on profit. Overall, revenue has been decreasing at a CAGR of 2.2% to total an estimated $32.3 billion in 2024, including an estimated increase of 0.4% in 2024 alone.",
