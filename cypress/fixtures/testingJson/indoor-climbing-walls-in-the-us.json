The portrayal of rock climbing in media, its debut at the 2020 Summer Olympics and the viral presence of professional climbers on social media have contributed to indoor wall climbing's mounting popularity. This burgeoning interest has turned indoor climbing into more than an alternative fitness routine; for many consumers, it's a lifestyle. Revenue has been climbing at a CAGR of 1.6% to $734.6 million in 2024, including a drop of 1.2% that year.",

Unionization efforts at several gym chains like Vertical Endeavors, Touchstone and Movement Gym could lead to improved employee wages and benefits, albeit at the cost of higher operational expenses. This shift toward better working conditions may enhance employee satisfaction and service quality, indirectly benefiting gym members. Those facilities that foster a strong sense of community and offer superior amenities will retain a loyal customer base. Revenue is projected to expand at a CAGR of 1.4% to an estimated $788.1 million through the end of 2029."
