    "executive_summary": "Companies in the Apartment and Condominium construction industry build new multifamily residential units, including apartment complexes, condominiums, townhouses and duplexes. Some companies offer construction management for projects. The drastic need for apartments has led to an expansion in construction through 2023. Overall, revenue is set to expand at an annualized rate of 5.6% to $86.7 billion over the five years to 2023. This includes a 3.0% drop in 2023 as inflation slows construction activity.",

            "current_performance_point_description": "Construction remained essential amid the pandemic, leading to more projects. Companies that followed health and safety regulations could continue operations, facing only minor setbacks. Apartment and condo builders received much of the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) to help cover payroll expenses. Low interest rates led investors and private companies to start new housing construction since the cost of borrowing remained low. Private companies could buy up land for less than market value, as landowners were trying to raise money amid economic uncertainty. This gave companies more space to begin building apartments and condos. The price of materials and fuel also skyrocketed temporarily after the pandemic, allowing developers to implement surcharges to accommodate for circumstances."

Contractors have stated that economic uncertainty has led to a delay in construction. Lower fuel and material prices have caused contractors to adjust their rates after raising them after the pandemic. The need for housing is still apparent as investors continue to fund new projects. While the cost of borrowing has gone up, this has been slightly offset by lower costs paid to contractors."

Co-living apartments have seen an uptick in popularity, especially in major cities. These apartments have a luxury feel while providing a shared space for residents. With many graduates facing increasing debt, co-living remains a budget option. The pandemic paved the way for more remote working opportunities for consumers. Having more apartments and condos allows them more flexibility in their work environment. Renters also do not have to worry about maintenance costs since many landlords and property managers are responsible for issues in a unit or building."

Rising interest rates bolster the rate of borrowing, slowing down investment in construction projects. In late 2023, the number of projects fell drastically compared to earlier in the year, indicating a slowdown. Price competition for a smaller number of projects will constrain growth. The price of material costs is also set to fall, following spikes earlier in the period. Fuel costs will also drive down prices as oil and gas prices fall from historical highs. Multifamily home builders will have to adjust their rates for projects and lower surcharges."

The National Multifamily Housing Council suggests that the US needs to build 4.3 million new apartments by 2035 to address the ongoing housing shortage. While immigration was sluggish amid the pandemic, it is set to reverse moving forward, which increases the need for more apartments. Texas, California and Florida are the three states that require the bulk of these new apartments."

New college graduates with student debt are unlikely to get approved for a loan, making renting a viable alternative. Renting offers immense flexibility since leases generally last a year. Renters can even sublet their places for a short period of time instead of breaking a lease. Sharing an apartment with roommates to split costs has become popular among the younger demographic. An uptick in vacancies will deter potential renters from new buildings."
