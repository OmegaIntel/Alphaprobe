    "executive_summary": "Frozen pizza producers contended with challenging operating conditions over the past five years, as rising competition from pizzerias, changing consumer tastes and rising health consciousness have gradually reduced the growth in demand for processed or frozen foods. A boost in disposable income levels enabled more consumers to order takeout or delivery from pizzerias, reducing demand for frozen, store-bought pizzas. In response, frozen pizza producers have reformulated existing products to reduce excess sodium and preservatives while introducing new varieties made with organic or all-natural ingredients.",

Frozen pizzas are preferred during economic hardships, as consumers lack the fiscal flexibility to eat out or purchase pizza from a restaurant. Overall, revenue is expected to expand at a CAGR of 2.3% through the end of 2024 to an estimated $6.5 billion in 2024, despite a 0.3% dip in 2024 alone."
