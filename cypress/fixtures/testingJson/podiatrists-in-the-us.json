Post-pandemic, a resurgence in sports activities, rising obesity rates and an expansion in the adult population revitalized the focus on foot and ankle care, leading to several years of stable but fluctuating revenue growth. Moreover, enhanced federal funding for Medicare, Medicaid and recreational programs bolstered payments for medical services, with industry-wide revenue projected to increase at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 0.9% to reach $6.8 billion by 2024, rising 0.7% in 2024.",

But practices opened and post-pandemic revenue increases were spurred by the rally in key demand factors (e.g., sports participation, obesity rates) and funding sources (e.g., federal funding for Medicare and Medicaid, total recreation expenditure) on top of the increasing trend in adults over 65, a crucial demographic."

In response to high competition from general practitioners, practices have made efforts to achieve greater visibility in the healthcare sector (IBISWorld report 62) by joint group practices to share the resources and costs necessary to invest in marketing."
