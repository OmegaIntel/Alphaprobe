    "executive_summary": "Revenue growth for the Beer Wholesaling industry has been supported by beneficial regulations and shifts in consumer preferences towards premium and craft beers. The three-tier system in the alcohol industry refers to the structured distribution pathway from breweries, through wholesalers, to retailers. This system benefits beer wholesalers by providing them a secure position in the supply chain. The shift in consumer preferences towards premium and craft beers has supported the industry by driving demand for higher-priced products, consequently leading to an increase in revenue and profit. Over the past five years, industry revenue is expected to have increased at a CAGR of 3.3% to $100.1 billion, including an increase of 1.9% in 2023 alone.",
