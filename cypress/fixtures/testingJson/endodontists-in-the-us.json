    "executive_summary": "The COVID-19 pandemic underscored the crucial role of funding and strategic planning in the endodontic sector. Although the drastic contraction in demand experienced in 2020 due to COVID-19 was inevitable, the sector's vigorous recovery was driven by access to funds. These funds, primarily sourced from private insurance and out-of-pocket payments, were ensured by factors of an increase in the number of insured individuals and strength in per capita disposable income. While operational costs declined or remained stagnant, wages persisted at a high level but did not significantly restrict revenue growth.",

The overall economic strength, indicated by escalated total health expenditure and high per capita disposable income, also backed the increased demand for service and boosted revenue since out-of-pocket, personal payments are a vital revenue source for endodontist services."

Regrettably, due to COVID-19, many individuals were compelled to postpone their endodontic treatment for a significant part of 2020, leading to a steep decline in revenue. When restrictions were rolled back, even as wages remained high with other costs declining or stagnant, the wage expansion was not enough to reduce revenue growth in 2021 and the years after."

            "cost_factor_description": "Inflation makes managing purchase costs challenging. Endodontists' revenues will be scraped away as materials and supplies costs rise. Supply chain woes and inflation have been the main factors driving up inventory costs. A strategy to minimize supply shortages is to stock excess supplies, which pushes up inventory costs while contributing to price inflation. The depreciation component of the cost structure includes the wear and tear of equipment (dental chairs, X-ray machines, microscopic scopes) that can be significant for endodontic practices."

Medical software is helping dental offices alleviate the burden on staff. While many dental practices are raising wages to attract and retain employees, others say the employees aren't there to hire. Burnout has forced many employees to leave the industry, while many have retired."
