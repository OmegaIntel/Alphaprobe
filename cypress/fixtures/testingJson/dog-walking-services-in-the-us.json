According to APPA's 2023 State of the Industry Report, pet owners spent over $136.8 billion on pet-related goods and services including dog walking and pet sitting services. Growing pet ownership and greater spending on pet care provisions lead revenue to grow at a CAGR of 5.0% to $1.7 billion over the last few years, including an estimated loss of 0.4% in 2024.",
