    "executive_summary": "Online media has challenged many traditional alternatives to billboards, like newspapers and magazines, slowly seeping into billboard advertising. Nonetheless, advertisers have continued to value Billboard and Sign Manufacturing industry products to reach mass audiences in an increasingly fragmented media landscape, benefiting demand for the industry. The effects of the pandemic undermined industry revenue in 2020 as downstream demand declined broadly, reducing advertising expenditure and business formation. The pandemic has also significantly hindered nonresidential construction spending, reducing demand for general signage from commercial, public and institutional facilities. While advertising budgets have bounced back and boosted demand for the industry, revenue declined at a CAGR of 2.7% to $14.5 billion in 2024, including a pitfall of 2.1% in 2024 alone as profit settles at 3.6%.",
