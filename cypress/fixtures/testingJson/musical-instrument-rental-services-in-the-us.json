    "executive_summary": "Musical instrument rental services include brick-and-mortar and online businesses engaged in short and long-term musical instrument rentals for individuals, schools, businesses, private events and government buyers. Companies have endured volatile demand through the current period, especially amid the pandemic. Plummeting consumer confidence alongside school closures and online learning limited opportunities for music programs, slashing demand for rentals and leading to monumental revenue drops. However, individuals had more free time and fewer entertainment options during lockdown restrictions; stimulus checks also contributed to more robust consumer confidence, encouraging consumers to rent and learn an instrument. Even so, climbing inflation has caused consumers to prioritize saving; ending lockdown restrictions has also enabled individuals to",

Since the industry heavily relies on demand from K-12 students and schools, online classes slammed growth in 2020. Many schools tightened budgets, cutting music programs during this period. However, excess leisure time during the pandemic encouraged adults and students to pick up instruments, leading to skyrocketing demand in 2021 and offsetting declines from 2020. Stimulus checks from the Federal government also supported consumer rentals."

Climbing inflation following the pandemic has posed a clear threat to musical instrument rental services; individuals have allocated more toward savings and essential items, like groceries and rent, while spending less on leisure, like music lessons and rental instruments."

Ending lockdown restrictions has also given consumers access to more leisure and entertainment options, cutting into demand for musical instruments. This trend has forced many companies to cut back, leading to lower employment figures. Nonemployers have especially struggled to compete with prominent brands with strong reputations, causing companies to exit the industry."

Musicians largely prefer to play and test instruments before renting; this action is impossible when renting online. Even so, online rentals may grow popular with less experienced musicians, especially students. Companies must emphasize employee knowledge and expertise to carve out a stable position in this evolving landscape. These core strengths will enable the industry to succeed through the outlook period."

Lower creative arts funding could result in fewer public lesson programs and fewer opportunities for musical careers; both of these eventualities would discourage people from learning instruments. However, government funding for primary and secondary education will climb, enabling schools to allocate more money toward rejuvenating music programs, counteracting decreased funding for creative arts. Similarly, strengthening consumer confidence will encourage individuals to spend on leisure activities, like learning an instrument. Students returning to school following the pandemic will remain the largest driver for musical instrument rental services."
