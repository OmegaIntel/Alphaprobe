    "executive_summary": "Engineers in the e-Discovery Software Publishing industry are essential for legal firms and corporations to produce evidence from electronically stored information (ESI). This software aggregates data from e-mails, text documents, databases, audio and video files, social media and websites. Increasing regulations regarding the retention, modification and deletion of ESI have prompted many companies to seek e-discovery software to assure legal compliance. Simultaneously, many companies use e-discovery software to handle internal disputes and information leakage. An explosion in the volume of data sent over the internet has also bolstered interest in e-discovery products. Both factors helped developers prosper for much of the period, despite a decline in 2020 due to COVID-19. Overall, revenue is estimated to increase at an annualized rate of 5.7% to $2.9 billion over the five years to 2023, including a 5.9% increase in 2023. Profit has also been strong in recent years, reaching 18.9% in 2023 and encouraging new companies to enter the ring and expand their workforces.",

Social media has also become a significant source of electronic data, which can be used as evidence in court. The task of identifying, collecting, and producing electronic evidence relevant to litigation is burdensome, but e-discovery software remains the most efficient solution."

In 2006, the FRCP was amended to cover e-discovery procedures, focusing on protecting instant messaging and e-mail. In April 2015, the Supreme Court adopted several key amendments to the FRCP, which increase the scope of e-discovery and the degree to which sanctions are imposed."

A 2015 Deloitte survey found that over half of government respondents would be unable to demonstrate the accuracy, accessibility, completeness and trustworthiness of their electronic information if challenged in a lawsuit. As a result, government agencies will purchase e-Discovery software to ensure compliance with federal transparency mandates as calls for government openness grow louder."

            "question": "How has the shift towards conducting business online affected demand for your services?",
            "answer": "The shift online has opened a new distribution channel for industry companies; the cloud. Through the cloud, customers can pay for services on a subscription basis and receive regular software updates. The COVID-19 (coronavirus) pandemic has increased the importance of conducting business online, driving companies to further invest in cloud computing."
        },
        {
            "question": "Has technology (i.e. data storage and analytics) affected the type of customers you sell to?",
            "answer": "Compared to costly one-time purchases, cloud-based solutions are marketable to a wider range of businesses, especially small, as these subscription options enable customers to pay less upfront and develop stronger long-term relationships with developers."

        {
            "question": "Is your company strategically located in a region that acts to your benefit?",
            "answer": "To attract the best talent, companies should be aware of the Silicon Valley area of California, Seattle, New York City and Boston as major tech hubs."
        },
        {
            "question": "Has your company been exposed to rising wages in recent years?",
            "answer": "The industry as a whole has been exposed to rising wages over the past five years as demand for employees is extremely competitive. This sector encompasses some of the largest and cash-ready corporations, including Microsoft, IBM and Oracle, who all push wages up. However, increased unemployment due to the coronavirus pandemic has temporarily relieved the burden of rising wages, although they are expected to rebound over the five years to 2026."
        },
        {
            "question": "Has your company prepared adequately to address the increased security risks posed by digital data storage?",
            "answer": "The cyberattacks on Equifax and web hosting companies, which have temporarily shut down Twitter and Spotify, are among a number of high-profile cyberattacks in recent years. Developers of internet-hosted (cloud) software must ensure that customers' data, designs and technology are protected. The increased usage of internet-hosted software during the coronavirus pandemic has increased the urgency of securing customers' data."
        },
        {
            "question": "Has your company been able to keep current with changing digital interfaces?",
            "answer": "It is vital for software developers, especially smaller companies, to be aware of changing consumer preferences. However, industry services are marketed to corporations, not the consumer. As a result, changing digital interfaces do not matter as much. Nevertheless, the coronavirus pandemic has increased the percentage of business conducted online, increasing the importance of keeping abreast of changing in business-to-business digital interfaces."
        },
        {
            "question": "Do you work with trade associations or other interest groups to advance your company's interests?",

        {
            "question": "Have any recent regulatory changes significantly affected your operations?",
            "answer": "Regulation plays a small role in the industry; given the highly fragmented nature of the industry, antitrust litigators generally do not scrutinize industry companies. However, companies in this industry must abide by social and electronic company regulations."
        },
        {
            "question": "Do you have any big projects that require capital financing on the horizon?",
            "answer": "Generally speaking, barriers to entry are moderate in this industry, though new entrants will be challenged to find and fund the right employees, often the bedrock of any successful company. As the overall economy recovers from the COVID-19 pandemic, companies are likely to increase hiring, intensifying competition for skilled employees."
        },
        {
            "question": "How does your company's profit margins compare to your main competitors?",
            "answer": "Profit margins remain high in this industry. The software industry generally has high profit margins as distribution and overhead costs remain low compared to revenue. However, profit margins declined over the past five years due to rising wage costs, along with the economic fallout of the coronavirus pandemic in 2020."
        },
        {
            "question": "Do you regularly use automation in your services? What proportion of automation do use in the process?",
            "answer": "For e-discovery software and services, automation is the name of the game. The less manual labor required to run an industry operator's software, the more attractive it will be to potential clients. The rollout of 5G wireless networks is expected to increase the ability of companies in this industry to automate their operations."
        },
        {
            "question": "How do you ensure your technology is consistently up to date? How have you adjusted your programs' functionality?",
            "answer": "E-discovery software often includes features that \"read\" data from diverse sources, including text, audio and images. As native file formats change, e-discovery developers will need to adjust their programs' functionality accordingly."
        },
        {
            "question": "Do you employ a range of workers that have technical expertise and customer skills? How do you go about recruiting employees?",
            "answer": "Many of the larger operators that provide e-discovery software shore up their sales pitch with the provision of after-sales service, troubleshooting and (in some cases) hands-on training for new clients. The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the essential nature of robust virtual and phone-based after-sales service, as social distancing restrictions make in-person support less feasible."
        },
        {
            "question": "How much do you rely on external investment? If investment funding should falter, how will you shore up revenue?",
            "answer": "As the prime rate increases, borrowing money, which fuels business expansions, becomes more expensive. As a result, companies may hold off on expansion plans until a later date and growth rates may be limited. Interest rates were brought down to near-zero levels in 2020 in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, making investment more affordable for companies in this industry. However, the prime rate will likely increase over the five years to 2026, as an economic recovery spurs the Federal Reserve to safeguard against excessive inflation."
        },
        {
            "question": "What proportion of your revenue comes from law firms? How can you boost demand from this segment?",

            "question": "How do rising online purchases affect demand for your company? Are you working on expanding your product offering to cater to online advertisers?",
            "answer": "An increase in the percentage of services conducted online will increase the amount of information that can potentially be discovered online and, consequently, increase revenue for operators. The percentage of services conducted online increased significantly in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic, a trend that is expected to remain in place even as the pandemic subsides, potentially increasing long-term revenue opportunities for industry operators."
