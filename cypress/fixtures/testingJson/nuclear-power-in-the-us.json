The United States has more nuclear electricity generation capacity than any other country, generating more than 771.5 billion kilowatt-hours of electricity alone, according to the Energy Information Administration's (EIA) most recent Electric Power Monthly report. Even so, public concerns about the safety of nuclear power have increased. Nuclear power producers have also faced rising competition from renewable and traditional energy sources. In response, nuclear capacity additions have slowed and older facilities have steadily closed. Nonetheless, in 2023, the country saw its first nuclear reactor, Vogtle 3, enter the power grid in 2016, with Vogtle 4 set to commence operation in 2024.",
