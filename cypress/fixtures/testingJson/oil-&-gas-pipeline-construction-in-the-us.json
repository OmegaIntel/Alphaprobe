    "FAQs": [
        {
            "question": "How has your company handled volatility in crude oil and natural gas prices?",
            "answer": "The construction of new pipelines is largely tied to periods of high energy prices, largely moving in line when capital expenditure is high. When energy prices are depressed, demand for new construction will fall off, limiting business opportunities because there is little incentive for downstream operators to contract industry services. Overall, industry demand will trend in line with the overall value of nonresidential construction, which is driven by forward-looking expectations of downstream customers."
        },
        {
            "question": "How does your company manage downside market risk?",
            "answer": "As demand for industry projects is generally tied to energy prices, industry projects can be canceled or put on hold as future expectations change."
        },
        {
            "question": "How does your company protect against input price volatility?",
            "answer": "Construction companies that are in proximity to key input suppliers will have reduced purchase costs and higher profitability. Furthermore, entering into long-term procurement contracts with suppliers in order to lock in rates, giving them upside protection. Construction firms located in proximity to project sites will exhibit reduced transportation costs and higher profitability."
        },
        {
            "question": "How does your company manage price risk?",
            "answer": "Specialized construction firms may have a given reputation in the space, boosting business opportunities. However, companies that derive most revenue from one or project types will likely exhibit overexposure to market risk. Should demand conditions decline, so too will company revenue. Contractors who operate in a variety of product segments will exhibit less volatility when demand and prices for a specific segment declines."
        },
        {
            "question": "Has your company been able to reduce wage costs via technological adoption?",
            "answer": "By automating administrative tasks via software and technology, labor resources can be redirected to more efficient tasks. The technical nature of skilled employees makes it difficult to replace these job functions with technology, however, labor costs can be lowered via the efficient subcontracting of nonessential workers and only keeping skilled, accredited employees on the books full time."

        {
            "question": "How has your company been able to leverage the commercialization of drone technology?",
            "answer": "With the Federal Aviation Administration's recent ruling on commercial drone usage, drones can now be legally operated by commercial operators below a specific height limit, with no licensure required. Drones have the capability to heat-map, 3D model, and scope out job sites. All of which will save labor, increase operational efficiencies and widen profitability."
        },
        {
            "question": "Is your company prepared to adapt to shifting environmental regulations?",
            "answer": "Contractors with a penchant for environmentally-friendly construction methods may be favored by the public, boosting contract tender opportunities. Noncompliant contractors will be subject to civil fines and penalties. Furthermore, the cost of not keeping ahead of certain regulations may increase operating costs, for the time being, reducing operator efficiency and profitability."
        },
        {
            "question": "How does your company ensure all occupational health and safety requirements are upheld?",
            "answer": "Compliant contractors will exhibit lower premiums and insurance costs, boosting profitability. As with environmental regulation, it is better for companies to embody a strong reputation for self-regulation and low incidence on job sites. A company that prides itself on a reputation of safety can expect to win more tenders, since insurance costs will be less compared to other, perhaps more risky companies. Noncompliant contractors will be subject to higher insurance premiums and cost increases, limiting profitability."
        },
        {
            "question": "Does your company face any issues financing ongoing operations?",
            "answer": "Due to the volatility of energy prices, some projects can be canceled or put on hold when conditions are unfavorable, limiting revenue growth. Contractors that enter into long-term maintenance contracts will have steadier cash flows."

            "question": "How does your company manage market risk? Are you able to quickly adapt to market changes?",
            "answer": "Due to wide annual fluctuations in demand, successful operators need to be able to adapt to changing market conditions. Those who specialize in one specific segment of the industry will be exposed to downturns in that single market more so than those who offer a variety of product services to a variety of end markets."
        },
        {
            "question": "How does your company manage the retention of skilled, accredited employees? What kind of skills do you seek out in a potential workforce?",
            "answer": "Since skilled employees command a wage premium it is critical for industry operators only to keep a minimal number of full-time employees on the books, which will limit labor costs while subcontracting less essential labor will be reflected as a purchase cost."
