    "executive_summary": "BPO companies have fared well recently, supported by a strong economy and rising demand in the human resource, finance, accounting and insurance sectors, collectively generating a large portion of BPO business. Also, rising wages and increased operating costs associated with healthcare expansion helped drive employers to BPO companies as a method of cost control. Nonetheless, rising wages have cut into BPO companies' profit. Revenue has been growing at a CAGR of 1.7% to an estimated $73.0 billion over the past five years, with revenue expected to inch upward 0.7% in 2024. Mixed economic outcomes, coupled with a higher frequency of layoffs from finance and insurance clients, has caused profit to slip and resulted in smaller contracts for BPO companies.",

Overall, falling corporate profit and reductions in the number of businesses stifled growth for BPO companies in 2020. Nonetheless, some service providers benefitted from the outbreak. Downstream markets demanded human resources services to help transition to remote work following stay-at-home orders and social distancing measures. The healthcare sector increasingly needed BPO companies for compliance and billing support."

According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, benefits, including health-related benefits, account for 29.4% of employers' costs, incentivizing many companies to use BPO companies' services. Surging inflation led wage costs to rise, while not in line with inflation, attracting clients to BPO companies to reduce these costs."

According to Bloomberg, 28.0% of tech layoffs were HR and recruiting roles, leading to increased HR services BPO companies have been and will continue to provide. While BPO companies have enjoyed an increase in providing various services amid layoffs, economic uncertainty and falling corporate profit have led to shorter contracts, overall price reductions and smaller contracts, subduing revenue growth in 2023."

The great resignation attracted utilities and energy companies to BPO companies to provide human resource services for hiring and training.

The proliferation of remote work among core clients, particularly in the banking and insurance sectors, enabled many business process outsourcing operators to shift toward remote work and engage with clients virtually. This has proven to be especially helpful, as recent spikes in inflation have accelerated many operational costs, so operators have been able to procure workers from a variety of locations around the world and conduct their services more efficiently."

Tech companies have laid off many human resource workers and financial services companies have laid off back-office staff. These layoffs will present BPO companies with an opportunity as services like compliance, human resources and accounting are cheaper to outsource than perform in-house. While BPOs will enjoy an uptick in outsourcing services, economic uncertainty surrounding these layoffs isn't wholly beneficial as it can bring about shorter contracts, overall price reductions and smaller deals, potentially subduing revenue growth moving forward."

As financial services and tech companies ramp up layoffs, BPOs will increase their workforce to manage the uptick in services they provide, increasing incentive-based payouts to attract workers and hindering profit. While artificial intelligence and automated systems aren't perfect yet, developments in this technology will allow BPO companies to reduce wage costs. As BPO companies increasingly invest in new technologies, they will become more vertically integrated, increasing operational efficiencies and reducing other costs like accounting, taking some pressure off climbing wage costs."

Global BPO companies with IT-integrated solutions are a considerable threat to traditional BPO companies as these solutions provide more accurate and quality results than traditional BPO companies. IT-integrated solutions can provide clients with real-time monitoring and analytics. IT-integrated solutions can also provide greater data security, attracting clients as data security concerns constantly increase. Adopting IT-integrated solutions is complex and challenging, so this trend will be a pain point for traditional BPO companies over the outlook period."

Healthcare companies will seek out BPO companies capable of securing the privacy of these records, so BPO companies must be able to provide IT-integrated solutions to attract these clients. As new virus variants continue to emerge, the need for compliance checkers may increase as healthcare providers face increased billing and compliance needs amid overrun hospitals. As the number of available health insurance plans continues to increase and become more complex, healthcare providers will seek out BPO companies to ensure their operations run efficiently."
