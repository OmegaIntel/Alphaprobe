Cementing operations are performed so that oil and gas wells are secured in place and surrounding environments are not contaminated by the extraction process. The use of cementing also improves wellbore integrity by preventing caverns from forming and other parts of the borehole from collapsing. Cementing services are also widely used to plug wells that are at the end their life cycle.",

This volatility led to anemic investment in new wells and rigs at times, causing demand for cementing services to slow. However, as energy demand improved upon the retracement of global lockdowns, drilling activity increased and benefited demand for well cementing services."
