    "executive_summary": "The Online Car Dealers industry flourished alongside the unique conditions associated with COVID-19, which boosted e-commerce sales across multiple industries. Lockdown restrictions limited access to in-person dealerships, forcing sales primarily online. Companies must strive to retain and convert first-time buyers into long-term, repeat sales. In many cases, online car sales are gaining favor among consumers that value convenience and efficiency. As more physical dealers incorporate online operations, competition has intensified as consumers can easily compare prices and features across websites.",

As a result, many brick-and-mortar dealerships operated at a limited capacity with social distancing guidelines, receiving lukewarm demand from consumers. The pandemic created unprecedented opportunities for online retailers, given lockdown restrictions."

Metal and crude oil prices skyrocketed, translating into higher new car prices. Similarly, semiconductor shortages slammed car manufacturing, leading to long lead times, car shortages and skyrocketing prices. Many dealers turned to used cars to replenish inventories; this trend led to similar used car shortages, forcing dealers to unilaterally raise costs to recoup losses from elevated purchasing costs."

Economic uncertainty has discouraged consumers from making big-ticket purchasing, reducing demand for new and used cars."

Similarly, competition from in-person dealers has revitalized as lockdown restrictions ease. Buyers, especially older consumers, will flock to traditional dealers, siphoning some demand from online stores."
