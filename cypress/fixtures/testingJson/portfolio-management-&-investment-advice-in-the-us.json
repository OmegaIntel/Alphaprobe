Rising assets under management (AUM) due to rising asset prices and growing disposable income have increased the base of assets that industry operators charge fees on. However, increased investor preference for passive asset management has driven expenses charged for asset management down. Financial markets play an integral role in AUM growth and base and performance fees earned by managers. Portfolio management and investment advice revenue has been growing at a CAGR of 6.1% over the past five years and is expected to total $543.9 billion in 2024, with profit set to grow to 33.6%.",
