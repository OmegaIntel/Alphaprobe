    "executive_summary": "Renowned for its vibrant flavors and healthful attributes, Mediterranean cuisine centers around fresh fruits, vegetables, whole grains, olive oil, and lean proteins like fish and legumes. Mediterranean restaurants experienced volatility in the last few years because of domestic and global economic changes. When the pandemic hit, many restaurant owners were forced to curtail dine-in operations, contributing to a massive dip in revenue in 2020, though an uptick in take-away order sustained many establishments during this time. Recovery was swift, once the government lifted stay-at-home orders, leaving consumers eager to eat out again. Rising consumer spending throughout the last few years has been a driver behind a rise in consumer expenditures on dining out. Demand for Mediterranean cuisine has grown.",

This growth has primarily been driven by the introduction of Mediterranean food to the fast casual dining restaurant model. Grain bowls and pita wraps can be prepared quickly, with various protein and veggie options available for customers to choose from. These meals are made of nutritious ingredients and are a healthier alternative to fast food."

            "current_performance_point_description": "For these reasons, growth has been concentrated in metropolitan areas, particularly near large commercial centers, because fast casual restaurants benefit from the daily lunch rush. Mediterranean restaurants experienced strong growth until 2020, when the industry took a hit due to the pandemic. Cities and states imposed stay-at-home orders prohibiting in-person dining and required nonessential businesses to keep employees at home. Without demand from office-goers, many fast casual industry companies generated less revenue. Since the pandemic, many employees have returned to work in offices, revenue experienced a significant recovery period in 2021 as many offices returned to in-person operations. Consumer spending has grown since the height of the pandemic, as pent-up demand has left people eager to spend on fast casual and full-service dining."

Gen Z and Millennial consumers are particularly adventurous in their preferences, but need to be discerning about what they pay to ensure they are not spending outside their means. Some cuisines originating in the Mediterranean region, like Italian and Greek, have been quite popular for years. Familiarity is important to consumers that don't wish to step out of their comfort zones. Other cuisines, like Egyptian, Lebanese and Turkish food are emerging as popular options for consumers looking to experience something new and different."

Over the next five years, Mediterranean restaurants are likely to follow a similar pattern to other food service industries that benefited from a surge in fast casual dining. The market will reach a point of saturation and restaurants will struggle against increased competition."
