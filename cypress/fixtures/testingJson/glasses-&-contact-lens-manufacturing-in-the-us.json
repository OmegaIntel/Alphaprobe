    "executive_summary": "While consumers have increased expenditures on glasses and contacts, competitively priced imports have increasingly met consumer demand, leading to revenue volatility for domestic manufacturers. And even though imports and exports stalled during the pandemic, import penetration expanded in 2021. Rising per capita disposable income, a growing adult population and improved insurance coverage have helped mitigate some of this volatility and bolster US manufacturers' demand. Meanwhile, new work-from-home norms and increased screen time have driven a higher need for corrective eyewear and contact lenses, supporting industry-wide revenue growing at a CAGR of 0.5%, expected to reach $8.4 billion in 2024. This growth includes a projected 1.3% increase in 2024 alone, where profit will remain on a growth trend, accounting for 8.6% of revenue.",
