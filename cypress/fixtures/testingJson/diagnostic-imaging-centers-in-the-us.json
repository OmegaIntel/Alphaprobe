    "executive_summary": "Diagnostic imaging centers play a crucial role in the US healthcare system, serving as the primary point of contact for patients seeking diagnostic imaging services. Imaging centers receive referrals from various healthcare providers, including hospitals, primary care physicians and specialists. As healthcare expenditure rises, diagnostic imaging centers receive more referrals as patients seek better health outcomes. An aging population's expanding medical needs drive growing medical spending, as aging adults have a higher incidence of disease and injury. The COVID-19 pandemic's disruption to healthcare spending disrupted diagnostic imaging, as healthcare focused on emergency care and coronavirus patients. Yet, recovering patient volumes for elective care offset this, leading revenue to expand at a CAGR of 0.8% to an estimated $23.8 billion over the past five years. As patient volumes remain steady and healthcare expenditure dwindles, growth in 2023 will be more moderate, increasing an estimated 0.3% by year-end.",

Imaging centers have more power in contract negotiations with private payers, resulting in higher reimbursement rates. Slow growth in private insurance coverage will limit revenue from private insurance providers. Medicare and other third-party payers are expected to implement more stringent reimbursement cuts moving forward. Reimbursement cuts will disproportionately affect imaging centers participating with Medicare and Medicaid. Imaging centers could feel reimbursement cuts deeply as they receive more Medicare patients as more adults become eligible. Higher Medicare patient volumes are unlikely to offset the reimbursement cuts."

Still, many small and locally focused imaging companies may be acquired by larger diagnostic imaging networks or join a health system. Cost pressures encourage small imaging centers to join a larger group or health system. Larger imaging centers can better adopt new and expensive technology and keep pace with rising wages."
