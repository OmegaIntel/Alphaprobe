    "executive_summary": "The industry comprises retail establishments selling paint, wallpaper and related supplies. Economic growth, particularly in residential construction, home improvement and consumer spending, has driven the industry. The pandemic led to a surge in home improvement as consumers spent more time at home, leading to a renewed focus on creating comfortable living and working spaces. Also, rising product prices have increased the amount of revenue generated from each sale, though they have also constrained demand from some market segments. Overall, revenue for paint stores is expected to climb at a CAGR of 0.7% to $15.8 billion through the end of 2024, including forecast growth of 0.1% in 2024. Profit has been boosted by growing economic activity and a significant decline in wages as stores have invested in technology.",

            "current_performance_point_description": "The DIY trend became more popular during the pandemic as people spent more time at home and cut back on other forms of discretionary spending, like vacations or movies. According to Harvard University's American Housing Survey, more than 70.0% of homeowners reported starting new projects during the lockdown. Of this, the survey classified nearly 30.0% of all projects as painting or staining. Paint stores encouraged DIY projects with themed color palettes and technologies like color visualizers."

            "current_performance_point_description": "While the home improvement market has benefited paint stores, DIY spending has been constrained as ballooning inflation cuts into discretionary purchases. Consumers have delayed some of these projects to allocate more spending toward groceries and everyday products. Alongside rising interest rates, housing starts and nonresidential construction activity have slumped. When construction projects and renovations grow more expensive, contractors and individuals limit paint product purchases."

            "current_performance_point_description": "Rising consolidation has been driven by several factors, including the desire to enhance market share, improve operational efficiency and capitalize on economies of scale. Rising competition has forced many small, independent paint stores to exit the industry, despite climbing revenue. Large companies have aggressively expanded, highlighted by the 2017 Sherwin-Williams acquisition of Valspar. Sherwin-Williams and PPG, the industry's two largest retailers, have also heavily expanded into Latin America."

In recent years, consumer spending has been relatively strong, supported by a robust economy and low unemployment rates. This has fueled growth in revenue for paint stores. The industry has benefited from stable demand for paint products, as well as efforts by paint store retailers to expand their product offerings and improve customer engagement."

Home improvement stores completely outmatch paint stores on convenience, providing a vast array of paint supplies alongside anything else needed for home improvement or other building projects. A limited selection will constrain the growth potential of many paint stores; many potential buyers don't want to travel to multiple stores while planning new projects."

New technology and apps have also enabled buyers to visualize paints and wallpapers in a room before buying anything. Also, some paint manufacturers, like Benjamin Moore, distribute their products solely to authorized independent paint stores. By purposefully distributing to independent retailers, paint manufacturers can give stores an edge that can shield them from external pressures."

This will support growing sales for paint and related products as homeowners and contractors undertake painting projects. An increasing focus on home improvement and renovation projects will stimulate growth in the coming years. As homeowners seek to personalize and improve their living spaces, they will spend on paints and related products, creating opportunities for paint stores."

        "Population trends drive the industry's landscape. Companies will struggle to generate sales in rural areas so they will often locate near major population centers. Many paint stores will concentrate near paint manufacturers. Stores can establish strong relationships with suppliers by locating nearby, which also reduces transportation costs.",
        "Small, independent stores struggle to compete with hardware stores and larger brands. Paint stores gain an edge through superior consultation and customer support services. Smaller stores carve out niche markets, cultivating brand loyalty. Many independent retailers become authorized retailers of specific paints, like Benjamin Moore products.",
