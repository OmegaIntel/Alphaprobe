Volatile steel prices have also impacted construction machinery manufacturers, hindering profit through 2023.",

These stimulus checks boosted working families' disposable income, which, in some cases, enabled them to move homes. The Federal Reserve also reduced interest rates to prevent an economic crash. Historically, low interest rates make construction projects attractive, including the construction of new homes and home renovations."

Higher interest rates also led to growing uncertainty within the financial markets. The larger interest rate hikes created panic among investors, discouraging new construction projects and harming construction machinery sales."

In particular, skyrocketing steel and oil prices have led to expanding purchase costs and profit contractions. Many larger manufacturers were able to pass cost increases onto buyers or secure long-term contracts to maintain steady profit. These companies have managed to expand profit. Smaller manufacturers have struggled with climbing input costs, leading to stagnating revenue."
