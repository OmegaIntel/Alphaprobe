    "executive_summary": "Over the past five years, online large kitchen appliance sales operators benefited from steady growth, as both rising e-commerce sales and rebounding construction activity boosted demand for operator goods. Sales of major appliances rely heavily on activity within the housing market, a trend that positively boosted operators as growth in housing starts and remodeling activity spiked during COVID-19. A further shift toward e-commerce kept revenue growth steady throughout the entirety of the five-year period. These trends caused revenue to grow at a CAGR of 12.3% to an estimated $13.2 billion, including an estimated 0.4% slip in 2023, as high inflation dampens discretionary consumer activity.",
