    "executive_summary": "3D printing and rapid prototyping services in the United States continue to benefit from robust growth over the past five years, driven by rapid technological development and new applications for 3D printing technology. While the falling price of 3D printing machines encouraged many companies to purchase their own machines and bypass outsourced services, demand has flourished. Additionally, as development and design services could be done remotely, the industry was one of the few that could continue operations unabated during the height of the pandemic in 2020, resulting in 7.0% revenue growth in that year. Over the past five years, operator revenue has climbed at a CAGR of 17.2% to an estimated $4.3 billion, including an estimated 19.8% growth in 2024 alone.",

Most companies use 3D printing to create prototypes because it is cost-effective, essential and manufacturers are often weighed down by the time and costs involved with traditional manufacturing processes. End-use parts represent another important source of revenue and often involve one-time orders of complex and unique parts. While 3D printing technology has advanced over the past five years, prototyping still remains the main source of profit as the quality of injection molding remains higher compared with 3D printing, as 3D printed parts often require extensive post-processing."
