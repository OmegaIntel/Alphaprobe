    "executive_summary": "Figures have been adjusted for inflation and are presented in 2023 currency. Adjustable bed and mattress manufacturers are experiencing a decrease in the current period due to various factors. One primary reason is the economic downturn that has resulted from the global COVID-19 pandemic. The pandemic has caused widespread disruptions in supply chains, retail operations and consumer spending patterns. As people face financial uncertainties and prioritize essential expenses, demand for nonessential items like adjustable beds and mattresses has declined. This decrease in consumer demand has led to a drop in production and sales within the industry. Furthermore, the pandemic-related restrictions have affected the housing market, causing a slowdown in homebuying activities, which directly impacts demand for bedroom furniture, including adjustable beds and mattresses. Overall, industry revenue is expected to fall at a CAGR of 2.9% to $1.9 billion going into 2023, including a 0.6% decrease in 2023 alone. Despite the current decrease in the industry, there are signs of stabilization in terms of profit. Manufacturers in the industry have been working towards optimizing their production processes, reducing costs and improving operational efficiency. By implementing lean manufacturing practices, streamlining supply chain operations and investing in automation, companies have been able to achieve cost savings and enhance profitability. Profit is expected to be 3.2% in 2023.",
