    "executive_summary": "The Deck and Patio Construction industry consists of contractors that design, build and maintain outdoor living spaces, including decks and patios, for residential and commercial clients. The need for deck and patio construction is highly correlated with the housing market's overall health. Residential construction thrived during the pandemic as housing stock and low interest rates led to new construction projects. This prevented contractors from declining significantly as many households spent additional money to upgrade their homes by installing a deck or patio. However, heightened interest rates have sent industry revenue into decline since 2022.",

            "current_performance_point_description": "While revenue declined in 2020 amid the COVID-19 pandemic, the residential market was a saving grace for contractors. Low housing stock and near-zero interest rates allowed for a boom in construction, which helped soften the blow of the pandemic. With work-from-home policies becoming more prevalent, households began contacting contractors to help improve their homes through decks and patios. Even so, residential construction activity plummeted in 2022 as the Federal Reserve raised interest rates climbed to combat inflation."

Non-residential construction fell significantly during the pandemic as business sentiment slumped and many businesses were forced to close. Clients put off the construction of patios, decks and other outdoor projects until further notice."

            "current_performance_point_description": "Supply chain issues were exacerbated amid the pandemic, leading to a spike in the price of sawmill lumber, which is one of the main inputs. Plastics and other materials also exhibited price hikes. In normal circumstances, companies can pass on costs to consumers through price hikes, but during economic turmoil, they are forced to absorb some of the costs. As supply chains have normalized, input costs have fallen, allowing deck and patio contractors to turn a more reliable profit."

Improved manufacturing technology allows contractors to use other materials as substitutes. While composite materials are expensive, they offer benefits like rot and water resistance. They are also more environmentally friendly since they are made from recycled materials. Composite materials also have lower maintenance costs, saving consumers money in the long run."
