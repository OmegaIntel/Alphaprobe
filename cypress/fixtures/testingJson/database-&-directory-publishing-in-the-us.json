The catastrophic fall of the Database and Directory Publishing industry between 2019 and 2024 has only been accelerated by the sustained migration from print to digital advertising, as publishers historically made money by selling print ads. Forced to focus on digital presence, the industry has experienced immovable competition from online search engines and social media platforms, limiting the industry's digital advertisement sales. Industry revenue has been eroding at a CAGR of 7.9% over the past five years; it is ultimately expected to total $6.5 billion in 2024, including a projected drop of 2.5% over the year, as directory publishing continues to struggle after the pandemic.",

Given that expenditure on print advertising is anticipated to fall at a CAGR of more than 10%, businesses are becoming highly selective in funding print advertisements. Many smaller directories have decided that operating offline ads are not worth their time and have canceled future advertising availability. Instead, they have turned to selling access to aggregated public records."

Search engines and social media sites act as more convenient substitutes for industry services on both the business and consumer fronts. However, social media information tends to focus on what is posted by users and not available from public records. Many consumers are unhappy that these data brokers exist and go to great lengths to pull their personal information off the internet; this has been enabled by the passage of GDPR, among other information storage laws."

Thryv owns the industry's only remaining household name brands, the Yellow Pages and White Pages.

Google's dominance in the advertising space, data centers of consumer behavior patterns and ownership of several operating systems have given the company a controlling stake in the ad marketplace alongside Meta (Facebook). As a matter of convenience, more consumers are expected to conduct business searches on Google, Facebook and similar general-interest sites rather than visit a focused digital directory or database to yield similar results. While some searches that can only happen on digital directories will remain on the platform, many companies will spool their own data aggregators if the underlying resource is free and the company needs it often enough."

As the industry becomes more digitized over the coming years, fewer companies will be involved with publishing physical directories, leading to a more competitive landscape that a few dozen national operators dominate. While consolidation will help decelerate the fall of industry profitability, price pressures will likely continue to erode industry profit gradually."
