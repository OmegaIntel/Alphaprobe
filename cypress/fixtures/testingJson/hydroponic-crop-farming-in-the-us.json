    "executive_summary": "Over the five years to 2023, revenue for the Hydroponic Crop Farming industry has grown. While overall vegetable prices have increased over the five years, industry revenue has been limited by years with significant crop price drops. However, extreme weather conditions damaged many crops for fresh field farmers, so grocery stores and farmers' markets quickly turned to hydroponic farmers to meet their demand. In particular, drought throughout many parts of the United States over the past five years harmed agricultural industries across the board, presenting an opportunity for hydroponic crop farmers.",

As farms returned to pre-pandemic production levels in the following years, fruit and vegetable prices surged. Hydroponic farms have been well-positioned with heightened crop prices to increase output and bring in greater revenue and profit. High market share concentration and competition from overseas have kept profit margins from growing substantially."

Hydroponic farms are less impacted by droughts, floods and other severe weather events because they grow crops in controlled environments. As severe weather becomes more common, hydroponic farms stand to benefit from disrupted vegetable harvests."

Hydroponic farms are less vulnerable to import competition than traditional farms because they are not affected by seasonal growth cycles. US vegetable imports have surged since the passage of the USMCA, which promoted increased trade between the US, Mexico and Canada."

Interest rates had been particularly low in 2020 and 2021 amid the height of the COVID-19 pandemic. As the cost of borrowing has risen, it's become more difficult for hydroponic crop farmers to purchase machinery, land and other capital necessary to grow more produce, limiting revenue growth in 2023. Higher interest rates have also cooled the economy, reduced agricultural prices and further hampered revenue growth."

Profit is expected to stay low due to competition and high operating costs. In addition, falling per capita consumption of fruits and vegetables and a decline in the healthy eating index will contribute to falling profits."

As inflation is expected to ultimately subside, the federal reserve will likely ultimately lower interest rates. Modest GDP growth will cause per capita disposable incomes to increase slightly in the near future.
