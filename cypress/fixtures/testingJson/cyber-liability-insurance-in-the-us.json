    "executive_summary": "The Cyber Liability Insurance industry has benefited from more services being conducted online, leading more users to exchange their personal and financial information online. Cyberattacks and hacking could result in customer identity theft and financial loss for a company, placing liability on the business. Cyber liability insurance has become increasingly attractive to companies seeking protection against financial losses from legal issues stemming from data breaches. E-commerce and online auctions have increased demand for services as these online retailers often fall victim to cybersecurity attacks. Over the past five years, revenue has been growing at a CAGR of 19.8%, and is expected to reach $6.0 billion in 2023. This includes an expected 7.7% increase in 2023 alone. Profit is expected to climb to 16.4% of revenue in 2023, up from 11.9% in 2018.",
