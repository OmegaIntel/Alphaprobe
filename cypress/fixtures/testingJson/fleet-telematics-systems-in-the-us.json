    "executive_summary": "The Fleet Telematics Systems industry has expanded rapidly through the end of 2023. Operators manufacture devices and develop service software to track the location and characteristics of fleet vehicles. Industry revenue is reliant upon demand from truck transportation, the industry's key downstream market, in addition to trade flows and the taxi and limousine industry. Although volatile fuel prices often distort industry revenue for the transportation sector, revenue is only affected if the industry's key markets encounter reduced revenue due to significantly deficient demand. This was the case amid the COVID-19 pandemic, which led to much lower economic activity in the US and overseas, including reduced demand for truck transportation and taxi &amp; limousine services. Nonetheless, demand will regain momentum amid the recovering economy. Fleet Telematics Systems industry revenue has surged at a CAGR of 5.5% over the past five years, pushed up by a 2.8% increase to an estimated $8.5 billion in 2023 alone.",

            "current_performance_point_title": "Demand Rises Alongside Transportation Activity",
            "current_performance_point_description": "As demand for truck transportation and taxi &amp; limousine services (IBISWorld report 48533) increased over the past five years, industry revenue soared. Greater software capabilities and more competitive pricing contributed to the emergence of new, niche markets. Still, the COVID-19 pandemic contributed to lower industry revenue growth due to travel restrictions. This has been and continues to be rectified due to the resumption of normal travel patterns. Also, outsourcing of hardware production and increasing saturation in core markets has tempered growth over the past five years."

            "current_performance_point_description": "Fleet telematics systems were initially hardware-focused. Most manufacturers offered devices that needed to be installed in vehicles. Installation across entire fleets required substantial investment from consumers, particularly those with extensive vehicle fleets. Fleet telematics systems manufacturers now differentiate themselves by developing software that is easy to use, flexible and provides advanced analyses and unique insights and efficiency enhancements. These new services include a software-as-a-service model, where consumers pay a subscription fee for access to a telematics system and software that is consistently upgraded and improved. The software is offered to consumers as a service and they can access data and analyses online."

            "current_performance_point_title": "Mobile Devices are a Simple and Convenient Way to Provide Software",
            "current_performance_point_description": "Rapidly improving software capabilities have led to greater telematics system use on mobile devices instead of installed vehicle hardware. Since most mobile devices are equipped with GPS and other communication capabilities, they can function as telematics devices once industry software is installed. As the number of mobile internet connections skyrocketed through the end of 2023, mobile telematics software has become one of the dominant product platforms in this industry. The increased reliance on technology has significantly boosted industry demand."

Utility vehicle fleets and construction equipment fleets, for example, represent new and fast-growing markets. Changing product offerings and platforms have facilitated the industry's penetration of new markets over the past five years. Since many drivers already use smartphones, subscription-based products require less up-front investment and fleet telematics systems are now more affordable to smaller transportation companies."

Combined with rebounding fuel prices, the Long-Distance Freight Trucking industry (IBISWorld 48412) will encounter fairly robust revenue growth over the next five years. Carriers will have more money to spend on fleet telematics systems, bolstering demand from the industry's key market. Also, the continued shift toward mobile platforms will make it very simple and easy for carriers to purchase telematics systems, making it a small risk for a potentially large gain."

            "future_outlook_point_description": "As public awareness of environmental issues increases, both federal and state governments continue phasing in more stringent emission standards for vehicles ranging from commercial vans to heavy trucks. Demand for fleet telematics systems will rise as these products help reduce emissions by improving fuel and route efficiency. The Department of Transportation's Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration recently introduced rules that require interstate commercial truck and bus companies to use electronic on-board recorders (EOBRs). These recorders monitor the amount of time a vehicle is being used, enabling regulators to track compliance with laws covering driving hours and emissions. Fleet vehicle owners have been encouraged to buy fleet telematics systems to comply with new regulations."

            "future_outlook_point_description": "The industry's expansion into new markets will drive higher industry demand over the next five years. As the price of fleet telematics systems continues fall, owners of small vehicle fleets will be able to afford them more easily. Due to this, the local trucking, taxi and limousine market will account for a larger share of industry revenue at the expense of the long-haul trucking market in 2028. This will also lead to an increase in industry exports, as foreign nations begin to value the higher-quality telematics systems produced by US-based manufacturers. Still, this will likely not have a material effect on demand as exports have consistently accounted for a minority share of industry revenue."

Rental companies, especially those specializing in heavy equipment, are also expected to continue expanding their use of fleet telematics systems to monitor their equipment and improve asset utilization. With the number of mobile internet connections forecast to climb through the end of 2028, demand for already popular mobile telematics devices and applications will also continue to rise. Fleet telematics systems will likely become integral to every industry that includes some form of transportation. This opens up the potential markets considerably, which will lead to industry expansion in the form of enterprise growth and increased hiring efforts."
