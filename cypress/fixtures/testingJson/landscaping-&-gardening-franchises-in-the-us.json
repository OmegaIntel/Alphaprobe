During most of the current period, growth in the residential and commercial property markets has increased demand for industry services. Moreover, surging housing starts and the rise in the value of residential construction has enabled increased investment in landscaping and gardening services by residential markets. Rising disposable income over the past five years has also benefited the industry. However, demand from the commercial market lagged during the coronavirus pandemic, as corporate profit fell and investment in nonresidential structures was limited. This trend resulted in a deceleration of industry revenue growth during the latter years of the period."

Franchisees can expect initial investments in the range of $50,000 to $100,000 for top franchisors such as Lawn Doctor and US Lawns. These start-up costs are significantly higher than non-franchise landscaping business costs. Nonetheless, high initial costs have not deterred entrance to the industry, with the number of establishments rising an annualized 3.8% over the past five years."

Recovering demand from the nonresidential market is estimated to buoy demand for landscaping and gardening services. Moreover, per capita disposable income is anticipated to rise, benefiting industry operators.

Moreover, drones, online estimating tools, specialized business management software, and crew tracking apps are anticipated to provide increased productivity and accuracy. Nonetheless, wage costs are anticipated to continue to rise over the next five years, as operators raise wages to maintain their workforces.
