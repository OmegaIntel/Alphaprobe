    "executive_summary": "The Allergists industry has generally benefited from steady demand, despite some significant revenue fluctuations over the past five years. Allergists are doctors who specialize in the diagnosis, treatment and management of allergies. A patient with an allergy typically must see an allergist, since not managing an allergy can be dangerous depending on its severity. As a result, allergists experience a near constant stream of demand from people with severe allergies. However, patients with less severe allergies may be more likely to put off visiting an industry doctor if other factors stand in the way, such as lack of insurance coverage. For this reason, the industry struggled in 2020 during the COVID-19 (coronavirus) pandemic, as shutdowns caused a spike in unemployment, and therefore, a decline in private insurance enrollment. As a result, industry revenue has increased at an annualized 0.8% to $4.0 billion over the five years to 2021. However, as the economy recovers from the pandemic, and businesses are able to offer in-person services again, industry revenue is expected to grow 4.8% in 2021 alone.",

The number of children aged nine and younger is expected to grow, expanding the industry's market for allergy testing, while federal funding for Medicare and Medicaid is also likely to increase, making it easier for some patients to seek industry services."
