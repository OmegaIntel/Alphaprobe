    "executive_summary": "Crane rental companies have had ups and downs, as volatility in downstream markets has weakened the need for cranes. The pandemic hindered performance as most construction, mining and forestry markets saw slumps, reducing the need for cranes. Even so, low interest spurred an uptick in residential projects, which provided a small cushion for lessors. As the pandemic waned, interest rates spiked as inflationary concerns crept up, weakening residential construction. Even so, this prompted industrial and commercial contractors to resume previously deferred projects. The escalation in oil and gas prices increased drilling and extraction activity, contributing to revenue recovery post-pandemic. The advantages of renting are particularly beneficial for these sectors as it alleviates them from bearing the burdens of depreciation and maintenance costs.",

Residential construction, which thrived amid the pandemic, began to contract as rising interest rates in 2022 and 2023 increased the cost of borrowing, leading to a slowdown in crane rentals and projects overall. Commercial construction encountered numerous challenges, pushing project timelines back amid economic uncertainty. It wasn't until 2023 that the sector regained footing, revealing signs of growth after enduring three years of sluggish performance."

This will allow residential and nonresidential construction to rebound as contractors can take on more projects and rent cranes through favorable contracts. Rapidly deteriorating infrastructure in the US will fuel a need for cranes. The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law will continue to provide funding for various infrastructure projects through 2026."

Because these prices can shift at any moment, miners will choose to rent to reduce risk. Even so, when prices are low, like the pandemic, lessors will see a drastic drop off in business as extraction activity weakens. While crude oil and natural gas prices spiked after the pandemic, they began to sink in 2023 and are set to slump through 2029, forcing extractors to cut down on excavations, leading to fewer crane rentals."
