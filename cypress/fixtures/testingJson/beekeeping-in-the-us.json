    "executive_summary": "According to data from the US Department of Agriculture (USDA), the number of honey-producing colonies in the Beekeeping industry in the US has decreased slightly in 2022 by 1.1%. Despite shrinking production volumes due to reduced farm and consumer demand, honey prices exhibited a 12.0% increase in 2022. A sharp rebound in consumer demand for agriculture products sparked increased demand from farms for pollination services. According to the USDA, which started collecting data on pollination services in 2015, revenue from that segment has supported industry revenue growth, until 2020 when it exhibited a 17.5% decline, causing industry revenue to fall 11.7% in 2020 alone. Reduced demand for pollination services caused industry revenue to decline 10.3% in 2022. Industry revenue has been falling at a CAGR of 6.7% over the past five years, and is expected to reach $624.2 million in 2023. This includes a 1.2% increase in 2023 as farm demand for pollination services continues to increase driven by consumer demand.",

About half of all affected colonies demonstrated symptoms inconsistent with any known causes of honeybee death, where a colony's worker bee population abruptly disappears, with very few dead bees located near the colony. This has wiped out much of the domestic capacity for honey production in the United States, which was an estimated 3.0 million hives in the early 1990s, dropped to a low of 2.3 million hives in 2008, and has stayed low at an estimated 2.7 million hives in 2023."

Nearly $500.0 million in illegal honey imports from China, while a surge in 2021 comes as a result of the increased import competition from Argentina. Overall, since industry products are priced in cents per pound, percent swings in industry trade values tend to be wide."

It is important to recall that since industry products are priced in cents per pound, trade values tend to swing rapidly on a year-over-year basis. The United States no longer imports large volumes of honey from China, primarily due to the restriction of imports through imposing higher tariffs."

Rather than competing with lower-priced imports, many operators have focused on sourcing bees to crop farmers for pollination purposes. The USDA estimates that bees add about $15.0 billion in value to US crop production every year. For example, almond trees are entirely reliant on honeybees for pollination. Due to the rising cost of pollination services and a rising price of honey, industry profit is expected to remain relatively high."

It is highly labor-intensive, so countries with low wages can produce honey at relatively low costs. Imports, especially from India and Argentina, pose a major threat to domestic production. Industry wages are expected to continue growing.

        {
            "question": "How have imports from low-wage countries impacted operations?",
            "answer": "Rising imports from low-wage countries have increased import competition, siphoning revenue from domestic beekeepers. The prevalence of illegal and illicit honey imports have undercut the domestic market in recent years. Diversifying operations to include pollination services will lessen reliance on honey sales."

            "question": "How have companies hedged against volatile honey prices during COVID-19?",
            "answer": "Apiculturists that enter into long-term supply agreements will exhibit stable revenue due to contracted rates, giving them downside protection. Furthermore, with an expected level of income, farmers can also redeploy resources to diversify products sold, such as queen bees and wax."

        {
            "question": "How do companies protect against volatile fuel prices?",
            "answer": "Beekeepers that provide pollination services for key local clients will have reduced fuel purchase costs, widening margins. Beekeepers who sell honey and beeswax locally will exhibit lower fuel costs, benefitting profit margins. Furthermore, beekeepers who enter into long-term purchasing agreements will lock in prices protecting themselves from upside risk."

            "question": "Have companies used drones to monitor hives and colonies?",
            "answer": "With the Federal Aviation Administration allowing the use of commercial drones, labor can be saved by monitoring colonies remotely. Beekeeping is notoriously labor-intensive, and this represents a significant opportunity to leverage capital developments."

            "question": "How do farms ensure compliance with organic and labeling regulations?",
            "answer": "Organic produce trades at a significant premium over traditional honey. However, labeling honey as organic, or as any other type of flower or type or grade disingenuously entails heavy fines. Honey fraud is frowned upon."

            "question": "How do company profit margins compare to competitors?",
            "answer": "Beekeepers that can trim labor costs through the hiring of seasonal labor will exhibit wider profit margins. Beekeepers that can ensure a steady supply of inputs and consistent production will have reduced purchase costs, benefitting profit margins."
        },
        {
            "question": "What challenges does the industry face financing operations?",
            "answer": "Returns for beekeepers tend to follow fluctuations in the agricultural sector at large, inhibiting certainty of returns. Government payments have made up the largest share of net sector income now than ever recorded. Farms are facing a liquidity crisis, with government payments accounting for nearly 50.0% of sector net income in 2020."

        {
            "question": "How do beekeepers ensure colony health and wellbeing?",
            "answer": "Honeybee populations have been devastated by colony collapse disorder, a problem that has been abating but has caused a significant slowdown in the rate of increase in hives and apiculturists. As bees become more limited, the price of pollination services and honey will rise."
        },
        {
            "question": "Have beekeepers adopted a commercial focus?",
            "answer": "Pollination services rather than honey sales have become the industry's most profitable and most abundant segment. Operators who rent out their hives to almond groves and other agricultural producers for pollination of crops will succeed very well."
        },
        {
            "question": "How do beekeepers maintain product quality?",
            "answer": "Operators must work to ensure that their products are of high quality, more specifically since organic produce and other artisanal goods trade at a premium and will garner more revenue per sale."

            "question": "Do companies promote honey as an alternative to sugar?",
            "answer": "As consumption of sugar and sweeteners, including syrups, such as honey, increases, demand for industry products rises as well. Promoting the health benefits of honey over sugar via an ad campaign can increase industry sales."
        },
        {
            "question": "Are certain products more sensitive to fluctuations in disposable income?",
            "answer": "Per capita disposable income determines an individual's ability to purchase goods or services. Typically, as income rises consumers will trade up for higher-margin products such as organic or specific flower honey."
        },
        {
            "question": "Do beekeepers conduct pollination services?",
            "answer": "Beekeepers have turned to pollinate crops amid a shortage of honey bees into their most profitable and largest segment. Overall, pollination services have surpassed honey for the first time in 2019."
