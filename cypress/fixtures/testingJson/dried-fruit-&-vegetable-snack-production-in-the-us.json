    "executive_summary": "Dried fruit and vegetable snack producers benefited from consistent consumer demand and a growing emphasis to stay healthy, with customers incorporating dried fruits and vegetables to be consumed as snacks or as ingredients in other food products such as granola bars, baked goods and salads. Over the past five years, producers also benefited from improving economic conditions, prior to COVID-19. Operators have grown steadily as consumers have increasingly sought out healthier alternatives to traditional salty snacks. While operators' goods are more expensive than traditional snacks, as discretionary income grew, renewed consumer spending helped boost sales for fruit bars, vegetable chips and other mixed snack foods that include dried fruit and vegetables. These trends caused revenue to grow at a CAGR of 2.0% to an estimated $5.2 billion through the end of 2023, including an anticipated 5.3% spike in 2023 alone due to continuing consumer trends.",

Even as economic conditions endured significant volatility during COVID-19, operators' production output continued to pick up pace, as consumers shifted their propensity toward healthier snacks that have less calories and sodium. Strong growth in disposable income during the pandemic also benefited operators, since dried fruit and vegetable snacks are considered a premium snack due to their higher cost of production; as inflation has spiked, a drop in disposable income was offset by spikes in commodity prices."

As supply chains have endured significant volatility during COVID-19, prices of fruits and vegetables have spiked; although this did curtail profitability for operators, it actually benefited revenue growth, as producers can pass on these costs to downstream customers. Since the production costs of operators' products have spiked, operators continue to look beyond domestic production and import a higher range of goods, with growth in the Trade-Weighted Index exemplifying this trend."
