Declining prices for fuel and crude oil over the past decade have helped bolster demand for trucks and sport utility vehicles at the expense of compact cars and sedans. Furthermore, automakers' response to changing consumer preferences has been to shift production away from industry-relevant vehicles. As a result, industry revenue has suffered during the period, while the COVID-19 pandemic accelerated industry decline trends. Industry revenue will likely decline an annualized 2.3% to $100.9 billion over the five years to 2022, despite an anticipated 2.6% increase in 2022.",
