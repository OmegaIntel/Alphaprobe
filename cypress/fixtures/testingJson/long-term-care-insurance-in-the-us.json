The industry comprises companies that provide insurance policies that help pay for the care provided in nursing homes, assisted living facilities, adult day care centers and in-home senior care services. This industry typically benefits from steady demand because Medicare and private health insurance companies often do not cover these services. The most vital driver of this industry has been a growing elderly population.",
