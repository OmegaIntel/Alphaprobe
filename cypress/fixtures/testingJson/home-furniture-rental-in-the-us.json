    "executive_summary": "The Home Furniture Rental industry serves customers who lease or rent furniture products, including bed frames, couches, dining room tables, and other home products. The industry primarily caters to individuals with an immediate short-term need, like college students or those who lack the necessary income or credit to purchase these big-ticket items. This industry is countercyclical to the economy, performing well in difficult economic times when consumer confidence and spending are limited. Conversely, during good economic times, when disposable income levels are high, credit is more accessible, and consumer spending is rising, consumers are more likely to purchase home furniture rather than rent it. Industry revenue has been shrinking at an annualized 2.4% over the five years to 2024 and is expected to total $631.8 million in 2024 when revenue will drop an estimated 3.0%.",

Individuals are more likely to purchase furniture rather than rent as incomes rise. Mass merchandisers and online retailers have increasingly offered furniture at a less expensive price point, making the monetary difference between renting and purchasing furniture less drastic. The popularity of peer-to-peer rental platforms like Neighbor or Fat Llama, which allow individuals to rent furniture directly from each other, has risen."

Online retailers benefit from lower costs because they typically do not need to pay for large showroom spaces and often have a smaller workforce. Mass merchandisers and warehouse clubs like Walmart Inc. and Target compete with home furniture rental companies. Many stores offer financing options like zero-interest payment plans or rent-to-own programs, making furniture purchases more accessible and potentially comparable in monthly cost to renting."

When income levels and spending are low, consumers often rent furniture rather than purchase it outright. Because of rising per capita disposable income and consumer spending, consumers have been more apt to purchase new furniture as their income levels have increased, leading to a significant decline in demand for home furniture rental. These factors, coupled with increasing external competition have led to operators exiting the industry. To mitigate losses, companies have implemented cost-cutting measures, like closing down underperforming locations and decreasing their workforce, which has expanded profit."

Declining demand and revenue will likely cause businesses to exit the industry entirely. Industry consolidation will also increase as companies who can stay in the industry acquire smaller, localized businesses to increase geographic presence.
