    "executive_summary": "The iron and steel manufacturing industry has grown at a CAGR of 4.9% to an estimated $139.6 billion in 2024, driven primarily by commodity price increases, with production volumes experiencing mixed trends. Prices for iron and steel have historically exhibited high volatility. Factors such as growing demand from developing economies, disruptions in supply chains due to COVID-19 and geopolitical tensions, notably the Russian-Ukraine conflict, have contributed to this volatility. Production volumes were bolstered by construction sector activity early in the period but later declined due to lower demand from commercial property and housing sectors, driven by rising mortgage rates and pandemic-related impacts.",

Products are made mainly from iron and steel scrap, which trend with iron ore and raw steel prices.
