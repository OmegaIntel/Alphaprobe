Due to a strict regulatory environment and decreased demand from consumers amid the COVID-19 pandemic, industry revenue endured notable volatility in 2020 due to an increase in government-issued stimulus checks, rent freezes, mortgage forbearances and establishment closures, which lowered spending and lowered demand for loan services. Nonetheless, the reopening of the economy and rising inflationary pressures that followed the pandemic increased consumers' dependence on the industry's array of services.",
