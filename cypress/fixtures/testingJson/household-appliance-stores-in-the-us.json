    "executive_summary": "While appliance sales dipped in the immediate wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, a surge in home renovation projects and a strong residential construction market boosted demand for major home appliances. As stay-at-home measures persisted into 2020, consumers, aided by federal stimulus packages, took on home renovation projects as more time was spent at home. Similarly, strong demand for new homes led to increased housing starts, further increasing demand for new home appliances.",

This revival subsequently led to a spike in visits to appliance stores as consumers sought to equip homes with new kitchen and laundry appliances. The swift expansion in the number of remote employees has encouraged numerous families and individuals to seek out single-family homes in the suburbs. This boost in housing market activity has enticed consumers to purchase new appliances, providing benefits to the industry."

Prior to the pandemic, consumers generally didn't purchase large high-profit appliances online; however, pandemic restrictions reduced hesitancy and forced buyers to research and purchase home appliances via e-commerce sites. Amid appliance shortages and price increases, online retailers enabled buyers to search more readily for in-stock items and competitive prices."

Major retailers benefit from economies of scale and established supplier relationships, enabling them to pass cost savings on big-ticket items, like laundry machines, down to the consumer.

Consumers have already started actively seeking out and purchasing items with lower energy use, less water consumption and greater recyclability. The federal government's expired Energy-Efficient Appliance Rebate Program supported this trend early in the previous five years. This program heightened consumers' awareness of green appliances. Consequently, consumer household appliance stores will face increased sales of energy-efficient appliances over the coming five years."
