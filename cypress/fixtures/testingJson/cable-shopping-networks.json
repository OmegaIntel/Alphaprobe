Industry operators have also experienced rising competition from online retailers, as consumers are increasingly shopping online, with e-commerce sales rising strongly over the past five years. As a result, industry revenue has fallen an annualized 6.7% to $5.3 billion over the five years to 2022, including a decline of 6.2% in 2022 alone.",
