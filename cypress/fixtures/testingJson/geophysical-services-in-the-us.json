Revenue plunged in 2020 as COVID-19 caused a major slowdown in economic activity and a large drop in oil and gas prices. Revenue continued to decline in 2021 as falling nonresidential construction constrained demand for surveying. The industry performed well in 2022 as the conflict in Ukraine raised oil prices, but revenue turned negative again as recessionary fears constrained corporate profit and industrial production.",

The onset of COVID-19 had significant adverse effects on revenue in 2020, as an economic slowdown reduced spending activity by oil and gas companies, renewable energy providers and other businesses."

The economy has been recently affected by rising interest rates, as the Federal Reserve has increased the cost of borrowing to curb inflation. Soaring interest rates have constrained consumption, threatening to put the economy into a recession. Recessionary fears have made companies weary, constraining corporate profit and industrial production. This has caused revenue to creep downward in 2023 and 2024."

Lower energy prices will discourage oil and gas companies from searching for new resources since they won't profit as much from their adventures, hindering revenue growth. Revenue will also be constrained by falling demand from mining. As supply chain disruptions ease, commodity prices will fall, constraining revenue from mining companies."

For this reason, revenue from these markets will soar during the outlook period as consumers and businesses become more environmentally friendly. Additionally, the Biden administration supports goals to generate net-zero emissions by 2035.

        {
            "question": "How does the energy market influence profit growth?",
            "answer": "A stronger energy market increases demand for geophysical services, which boosts profit. Profit is strongly influenced by changes in oil and gas prices. When energy prices drop, demand declines and companies engage in pricing competition, hindering profit. When oil and gas prices soar, it indicates increased spending on services, benefiting the industry and raising profit."

        {
            "question": "What is the role of skilled workers in this industry?",
            "answer": "Geophysical services require highly skilled professionals to operate equipment and analyze results. For this reason, wages comprise nearly one-third of revenue. Compensation's revenue share has crept downward during the current period as high inflation has put upward pressure on other categories instead of wages."

        {
            "question": "What factors contribute to revenue volatility?",
            "answer": "The industry has moderate revenue volatility. Volatile crude oil prices have caused fluctuations, like plunging demand during COVID-19 in 2020 and surging prices in 2022 due to the Ukraine conflict. Government action on renewable energy, infrastructure funding, and legislation changes also enhance volatility."
