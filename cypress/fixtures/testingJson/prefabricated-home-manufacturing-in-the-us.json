When traditional site-built homes drop in price and become more widely affordable, demand for manufactured and modular homes declines since consumers prefer to purchase traditional homes. Amid inflated prices for on-site constructed homes and low-interest rates, demand for prefabricated homes increased, especially among first-time homeowners and retirees.
