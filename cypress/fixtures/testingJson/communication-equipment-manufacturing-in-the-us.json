    "executive_summary": "Communication equipment manufacturers have endured multiple challenges and have struggled to maintain profit levels. This trend is mainly driven by high research and development (R&D) costs and falling equipment prices driven by elevated price competition. Since the industry is diverse, specific product segments may perform better than others, and large companies with contracts in place will be less affected than smaller manufacturers. The need for work-from-home equipment boosted demand for manufacturers, although falling input and product prices resulted in contracting revenue. The pandemic and other supply chain disruptions have greatly hindered the industry, and the volatility in the cost of semiconductors, along with investor uncertainty, has posed immense challenges for manufacturers.",
