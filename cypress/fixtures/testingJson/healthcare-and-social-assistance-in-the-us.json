The population's medical needs are expanding the oldest demographic's consumption of medical services. At the same time, growing incomes and broader insurance coverage facilitate access to healthcare providers. Increasing healthcare spending was abruptly disrupted by the pandemic, exposing healthcare and social assistance providers to unprecedented financial and operational pressures. Though pandemic concerns have alleviated, the long-term effects of it continue to shape every corner of the health sector. Still, revenue has been expanding at a CAGR of 0.7% to an estimated $3.6 trillion over the past five years, with revenue rising an expected 0.3% in 2024.",
