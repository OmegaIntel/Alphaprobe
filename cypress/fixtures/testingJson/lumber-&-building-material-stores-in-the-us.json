To differentiate themselves from large home improvement stores, lumber and building material stores have added customizable and niche items to their product offerings, including eco-friendly product lines.

Still, higher prices also may have impacted consumer purchases, potentially reducing sales volumes. The Inflation Reduction Act's extension of tax credits for energy-efficient homes boosted private spending on home improvements, bolstering the plumbing and HVAC equipment segments for lumber and building material stores. Despite slight slowdowns in the residential market because of interest rate hikes, stores did not face considerable declines as DIY residential projects climbed. Also, nonresidential construction markets picking up greatly benefitted lumber and building material stores as the residential construction market cooled off."
