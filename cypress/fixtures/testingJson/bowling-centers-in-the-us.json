Revenue plummeted because of business closures and shelter-in-place orders in 2020, then spiked in 2021 thanks to rising disposable income propping up discretionary spending. Profit was as volatile as revenue but stabilized post-pandemic with the assistance of government aid. In line with the unprecedented losses experienced in 2020, industry-wide revenue has been falling at a CAGR of 5.2% over the past five years and is expected to total $3.8 billion in 2024, when revenue will contract an estimated 2.2%.",

This grows economies of scale purchasing power of enterprises and the ability to spread costs over a larger customer base."
