    "executive_summary": "Major record labels have finally adapted to the new age. While labels enjoyed strong growth before the Internet, the rise of illegal file sharing and the corresponding decline in album sales pressured the industry over the past two decades. The rapid adoption of streaming services has pushed album sales down even more and challenged major labels who needed to prepare for the fundamental shift to online music streaming. Still, things are on the mend for major labels as they have successfully adapted to the new streaming landscape.",

This has devastated album sales and siphoned demand from physical music consumption and digital downloads. With the emergence of music streaming platforms, consumers do not need to buy a digital album and only buy physical albums in the case where they prefer the tangible experience or are hobbyists who enjoy collecting physical media such as vinyl records."

TikTok especially has emerged as a force of nature in the music industry and is responsible for some of music's biggest hits over the past five years, like Sam Smith and Kim Petras's \"Unholy,\" which immediately rose to number one on Billboard's Hot 100 list and went on to win a Grammy for Best Pop Duo."

While major labels have adapted to streaming, higher rates will help compensate for previous losses from declining purchases. At the same time, mounting royalty rates will lead labels to experience a slump in profitability, especially if they cannot pass on these additional costs to consumers."

Contrary to early fears, streaming has not entirely cannibalized physical music sales. Instead, streaming has complemented physical sales by introducing music to new audiences and encouraging fans to explore artists' entire discographies, including their back catalog available on physical formats. Still, album sales are past their prime and major labels won't be able to rely on them for consistent revenue."
