    "executive_summary": "Entertainment insurers can provide industry services to companies and individuals involved in entertainment production such as film, television and live performances. Industry operators provide insurance policies to protect staff, equipment and rentals from injury, damage or loss. The industry is an indispensable part of risk management in the entertainment industry. Many entertainment companies view policies as inelastic, although some may choose to decrease consumption of insurance policies should premium prices increase too much. Similar to other insurance industries, policy pricing fluctuates between cycles of price-cutting (softening) and price-raising (hardening). Over the past five years, revenue has grown at a CAGR of 2.7% to $27.5 billion, including an expected 1.6% increase in 2024. Profit is expected to lag to 10.5% of revenue in 2024 from 13.3% in 2019.",

While there are other factors that determine industry premium values, demand for industry services is closely linked to the financial performance of entertainment industries.

Due to shutdowns brought on by the pandemic, concerts, performances and festivals were temporarily prohibited in most parts of the United States. As film and TV sets have reopened following the pandemic, entertainment insurance has been in high demand, since operating these productions while the virus still present carries a high degree of risk."

            "current_performance_point_description": "As the virus began to spread in the United States in early 2020, performances and concerts were forced to either postpone or cancel, while film and TV sets were forced to shut down production. Due to these cancelations, industry companies were required to pay out on cancelation policies, which ensured that production companies did not experience massive debts if they were unable to put on events. As a result of these higher expenses amid the pandemic, industry companies generated less profit in 2020. As lockdown measures were lifted the industry was able to grow industry profit from pandemic-lows, however, industry profit has not grown to pre-pandemic levels. Wage growth has outpaced revenue growth over the past five years, putting downward pressure on industry profit."
