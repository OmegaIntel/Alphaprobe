Policies offered by industry operators provide coverage for the cost of reclaiming one's financial identity, including the cost associated with required paperwork, wages lost due to identity theft and expense of hiring an attorney. As the number of Americans affected by identity theft has increased, so too has industry revenue.

Accordingly, the number of industry operators is expected to increase at an annualized rate of 8.6% to 68 enterprises over the five years to 2027. Similarly, industry operators are projected to increase their labor force to manage increased demand for their services. As a result, industry employment is forecast to increase an annualized 7.8% to 3,089 workers over the next five years."

As a result, the benefit limits for policies that exceed $10,000 are viewed as misleading by some consumer groups.
