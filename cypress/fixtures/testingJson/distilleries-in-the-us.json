            "answer": "The average distillery focuses on producing one or two types of spirits, given the cost, equipment and space needed to make various types of spirits. However, the industry's largest distilleries generally specialize in or are well-known for a particular spirit while producing a variety of lesser-known spirits. While most distilleries focus on one or two spirits, most offer products at a range of price points to ensure demand remains stable despite shifts in the economic landscape."
        },
        {
            "question": "How do distilleries market themselves to help themselves stand out from competitors like wineries and breweries?",
            "answer": "Distilleries showcase the unique process of distillation, emphasizing craftsmanship, quality of ingredients and maturation time for spirits, which differs substantially from wine or beer production. Distilleries often create experiential marketing through distillery tours, tasting sessions and pairing dinners to build connections with consumers, offering them a behind-the-scenes look into the spirit-making process."
        },
        {
            "question": "How do distilleries navigate through volatile input costs?",
            "answer": "Distilleries often hedge against unpredictable costs by buying a year's worth of grains or other ingredients in advance, locking in prices to control expenses. They can also adapt their product lines, favoring products with less expensive inputs when costs increase suddenly."
        },
        {
            "question": "Has your distillery explored relocating establishments to areas of the country with lower wages and operational costs?",
            "answer": "Most distilleries choose their establishment locations based on proximity to upstream suppliers and downstream markets. However, many distilleries, particularly larger ones, have opted to offshore in an attempt to reduce wage and operational costs."
        },
        {
            "question": "Has your distillery been able to reduce wage costs through any forms of automation in the distilling process?",
            "answer": "Many distilleries have introduced mass production processes that require fewer physical employees; however, because of the perceived lower quality of products produced by this method, it's often reserved for less expensive, lower quality spirits. Still, for many value brands that compete based on price, mass production reduces the average and marginal costs in production, improves profit and allows distilleries to keep selling prices low, enticing consumers."

        {
            "question": "How has your company kept its distilling processes and other proprietary information safeguarded?",

        },
        {
            "question": "What regulations must distilleries abide by?",
            "answer": "Distilleries must comply with local, state and federal laws related to licensing, production, packaging, taxation and sales, including obtaining permits from agencies like the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau (TTB). They must also adhere to stringent health and safety regulations, like maintaining sanitary practices, properly handling and storing raw materials and hazardous substances and ensuring employee safety."

            "question": "Do you work with trade associations or other interest groups to advance your company's interests?",

        {
            "question": "How do your company's returns amid economic downturns compare with your major competitors?",
            "answer": "Profit varies significantly across the industry, depending on an operator's spirit of focus, size and distribution channels, with large global operators typically producing higher returns compared with smaller counterparts. Often, larger distilleries produce various products with varying price points, enticing consumers with low-priced options during periods of economic downturn."
        },
        {
            "question": "How do rising wage costs impact your distillery's performance?",
            "answer": "Though wages account for a relatively small share of revenue, distilleries have increasingly competed based on the perceived quality of their products, resulting in many distilleries hiring highly-skilled employees, who command higher wages, to ensure top-quality products. Swelling wage costs typically place negative pressure on profit."
        },
        {
            "question": "What is your main outlet for promoting your new and established brands? Do marketing expenses account for a high share of your company's revenue?",
            "answer": "Marketing, especially brand positioning, is essential to success in local and international markets. The intense competition among brands necessitates large expenditures on advertising and promotion."
        },
        {
            "question": "Have you leveraged economies of scale to keep operational costs low? How could you better leverage economies of scale to favor your operations?",
            "answer": "Mass production reduces average and marginal costs, thereby improving profitability. The Distilleries industry is highly concentrated. The top distilleries keep a tight hold on their positioning because of brand loyalty and economies of scale, allowing them to keep operational costs low and try new brands and products for lower cost and risk than smaller distilleries."
        },
        {
            "question": "Do you have contracts with reliable input providers?",
            "answer": "Success is highly dependent on ensuring adequate quantities of raw materials. Distilleries typically establish contracts with reliable suppliers for key ingredients, like grains or fruits, to ensure product quality and consistency. They also make agreements with manufacturers for essential supplies like barrels for aging spirits, yeast and fuel for production."
        },
        {
            "question": "Impact of Changes in Alcohol Expenditure",
            "answer": "A boost in alcohol expenditure can boost distilleries' production, leading to higher profit. A drop in alcohol expenditure might result in reduced production, potential layoffs and potential financial strain for distilleries. During periods of economic downturn, it isn't uncommon for expenditure on alcohol to strengthen, as many consumers find the effects of alcoholic beverages to be enticing during periods of distress."
        },
        {
            "question": "Trade-weighted Index and Tariffs",
            "answer": "The trade-weighted index (TWI) measures the value of the US dollar compared with its major trading partners. A boost in the TWI represents a heightened value of the US dollar, resulting in exported products becoming relatively more expensive for foreign markets and imports becoming relatively more affordable for domestic consumers. Tariff hikes, particularly for bourbon, typically depress export sales."
        },
        {
            "question": "How do excise taxes on distilled spirits impact your company's ability to turn a profit? How do you keep track of changes in excise tax for distilled spirits?",
            "answer": "Excise taxes are levied on specific industry products by the state and the federal government. When excise taxes expand, distilleries raise the selling price of their products, risking losing consumers and declining revenue. Conversely, distilleries typically encounter lower returns if they try to stabilize selling prices and not pass along excise tax costs."
