    "executive_summary": "Figures have been adjusted for inflation and are presented in 2024 currency. Coffee manufacturers purchase coffee beans and process them into roasted or ground coffee products. In recent years, climate change has limited the availability of land for coffee production, putting a strain on the global yield of coffee. The world price of coffee has experienced fluctuations, but coffee producers have largely passed these costs on to consumers. Price-based competition has limited profit for some manufacturers, but profit overall has risen to 14.5%. An appreciated dollar during a portion of the current period has constrained industry exports. Revenue has expanded at a CAGR of 1.9% over the past five years to reach $13.3 billion in 2024, including a 0.0% drop in 2024.",

This leads to unpredictable price fluctuations, potential financial instability and adaptive farming practices that necessitate sustaining their livelihoods."

These products require less skill to prepare but yield a delicious product nonetheless, making them popular among high school and college students. Rising disposable income contributes to the increased spending on high-quality coffee products, which are often considered affordable but a luxury nonetheless. With more spending money, many consumers indulge in specialty coffee products. Consumer preferences have trended towards specialty coffee products in the last few years. The higher profit of these high-end products, like cappuccinos and espressos, has stimulated revenue."

This shift has led to a higher demand for quality coffee beans, stimulating coffee production and specialty roasting. Artisanal roasters and at-home brewers are increasingly sourcing high-quality beans worldwide. This will contribute to the stiff international competition domestic coffee producers will contend with and competition from manufacturers of niche products.

To appeal to time-strapped consumers, manufacturers will increasingly produce high-quality instant coffee products, as many coffee drinkers will refuse to compromise on quality for convenience. Cold brew and ready-to-drink (RTD) coffee products are rapidly gaining popularity. Their development is notably high, reflecting strong consumer demand.
