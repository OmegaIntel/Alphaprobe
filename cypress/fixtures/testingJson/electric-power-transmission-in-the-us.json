    "executive_summary": "An uptick in infrastructure investment has allowed electric power transmitters to raise rates, increasing revenue and profit. Since the need for electricity is inelastic, economic shifts typically do not impact transmission companies considerably. While commercial and industrial businesses were affected during lockdowns, residential consumers used more electricity because of stay-at-home orders, cushioning the blow from the slump in other sectors. As the economy reopened, revenue swelled, stemming from a combination of higher electricity prices and an expanding customer base. Overall, industry revenue is set to expand at a CAGR of 0.8% to $501.9 billion in 2024, including a 0.1% uptick in 2024 alone.",
