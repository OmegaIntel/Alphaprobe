    "executive_summary": "Breakfast restaurants and diners experienced greater volatility in the last few years because of domestic and global economic changes. Prior to the outbreak of COVID-19 and its subsequent economic impact, breakfast restaurants were bolstered by growth in revenue. When the pandemic hit, restaurant owners were forced to curtail dine-in operations, contributing to a massive dip in revenue growth in 2020. Recovery was swift, however, once the government lifted stay-at-home orders, leaving consumers eager to eat out again. Rising consumer spending throughout the last few years has been a driver behind a rise in consumer expenditures on dining out. Demand for breakfast restaurants and diners has grown, with the impact of the pandemic on revenue growth being relatively brief. Revenue grew at a CAGR of 1.7% to $14.6 billion over the last five years, including a rise of 1.8% in 2024 alone.",

            "current_performance_point_description": "Business at breakfast restaurants and diners is driven by consumer trends in spending and travel. Consumer spending has risen over the last few years, leading to a higher propensity for consumers to purchase food away from home and benefiting breakfast restaurant owners. When consumers travel, for work or for leisure, breakfast gives them the energy to get through their day. Without access to kitchens or time to prepare meals, travelers stop by breakfast restaurants to meet this need or as a chance to explore local eateries. Domestic travel experienced a sharp decline following the outbreak of COVID-19, hurting demand from hungry consumers during the pandemic. Travel has since rebounded as travel restrictions have been lifted."

            "current_performance_point_description": "During the pandemic, consumer spending declined amid an economic downturn. To cope with associated financial stress, consumers restricted discretionary spending and opted to prepare meals at home rather than eat out for breakfast. Domestic travel sharply declined during the pandemic as social distancing regulations, temporary shutdowns and limited operations in restaurants contributed to a major dip in revenue in 2020. Customer concerns about virus transmission led to some changes to combat safety concerns, like growth in takeout offerings, increased cleaning procedures and reduced dining capacity. This rise in purchases had the potential to hinder profitability, but falling wage costs helped boost profit over the last five years."

Fluctuating availability led to menu inconsistencies, forcing eateries to adapt their offerings based on ingredient availability, impacting customer choices. Cost fluctuations as a result of disrupted supply chains affected profit for restaurants, leading them to implement price adjustments for breakfast items, influencing consumer spending habits. To cope with rising purchase costs and falling demand, restaurant owners in this industry laid off many employees."

Many breakfast staples like fruit and eggs are considered nutritional options, making breakfast restaurants a place where people can easily watch what they eat. Increased attention on diverse dietary preferences like vegan, keto, paleo or gluten-free diets will drive eateries to expand their breakfast menus to accommodate various dietary needs and restrictions."

Consumers' emphasis on ethical sourcing will prompt breakfast spots to highlight transparency in ingredient sourcing, showcasing local or sustainable produce and fostering trust with patrons.
