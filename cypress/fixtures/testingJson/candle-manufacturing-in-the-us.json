    "executive_summary": "The Candle Manufacturing industry is strongly influenced by consumer spending power. Candles are highly discretionary purchases that compete with other home decor and air-freshening products. Rising consumer spending and new varieties boosted performance. The industry was resilient amid COVID-19 as stay-home orders caused consumers to invest more in household items like candles. However, as restrictions ease and travel resumes, consumers will spend less on household decor, hindering the industry. Revenue is expanding at a 1.7% CAGR over the past 5 years and expected to reach $2.9B in 2023, up 1.1%. Profit will drop amid rising costs.",
