    "executive_summary": "Figures have been adjusted for inflation and are presented in 2024 currency.\n\nOnline beauty stores have been booming in recent years, with the growing popularity of e-commerce driving this growth. During the 2020 pandemic, social distancing regulation and stay-at-home orders pushed consumers to leverage online platforms to fulfill their shopping needs, swelling demand for online sellers of cosmetics and perfumes. During this time, consumers were spending less on eating out and transportation, causing disposable income to grow and boosting demand for discretionary products. However, recovering in-person shopping trends and unfavorable macroeconomic conditions in 2022 and 2023, including elevated inflation and consumer certainty, led to revenue losses, although these were insufficient to reverse pandemic gains. These trends will cause revenue to strengthen at an estimated CAGR of 11.4% to $48.1 billion through the end of 2024, including a 2.4% gain that year alone.",

During the initial stages of the pandemic, consumers favored skincare products over cosmetics, as during this time, social distancing regulations and stay-at-home orders discouraged gatherings and events, discouraging consumers from using cosmetics as often."

            "current_performance_point_description": "This trend spilled over to 2021, largely because a reopening economy, rising disposable income and recovering consumer confidence boosted spending on beauty products. Revenue took a hit in 2022 and 2023 because elevated inflation raised consumer uncertainty and weakened disposable income, discouraging consumers from making discretionary purchases. This trend also represents stabilizing demand following the peaks of the pandemic."

This trend proliferated during the initial stages of the pandemic, when consumers relied heavily on online shopping. Beauty products and fragrances include a broad range of products that appeal to consumers with different needs and preferences. This, alongside the low capital start-up costs, has facilitated many retailers entering the industry."

This includes carrying a broad range of products, including those that are popular in social media. Foreign cosmetic brands, particularly Asian beauty products, are becoming increasingly popular among domestic buyers. As consumers have become increasingly curious about foreign brands, retailers have kept them in stock to adapt to changing consumer preferences."

This allows men to generate higher sales volumes. In many cases, sellers with a strong male audience benefit from strong brand loyalty. By appealing to this underserved group, brands that focus on male beauty products can build a strong customer base."

Consumers will continue to buy beauty products from online sellers, although drastic gains are set to become less common. - Although inflation has slowed down, it remains above the Federal Reserve target rate. Elevated inflation will continue to mute demand for new cosmetics, slowing revenue growth. - Over the coming years, demand for online beauty product sellers will continue to grow, particularly as inflationary pressures lessen. Higher disposable income will allow consumers to buy non-necessity products, boosting makeup sales. - Smaller retailers will struggle to remain competitive in the coming years, largely because consumers increasingly favor larger brands with a strong online presence and favorable reputations."

In line with this trend, retailers will also continue to carry a broad range of imported beauty products, particularly those from Europe and Asia, as these are largely perceived to be of higher quality by customers. By adjusting their product offering, these sellers can appeal to more customers."
