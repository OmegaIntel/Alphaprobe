    "executive_summary": "Positive trends in demand variables and near-constant demand from poultry processors, along with a recovery in the price of poultry meat in 2021 and 2022, have led to rising industry revenue over the five years to 2024. Additionally, increased demand for chicken as a substitute for other meats, particularly red meat, helped limit revenue declines amid the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition, increasing health consciousness among US consumers has boosted consumption of white meat in general. A rising price of feed from a low prior to the period has also driven growth. Higher feed and poultry prices have aided industry profit as rising purchase costs have been passed along to customers. Moving forward, industry conditions will remain relatively consistent. Per capita poultry consumption will continue to rise, albeit at a slower rate.",
