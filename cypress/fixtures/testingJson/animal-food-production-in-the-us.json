    "executive_summary": "The Animal Food Production industry primarily serves households and agricultural industries. Pet food sales follow macroeconomic conditions, while farming industries rely on animals as revenue sources and are more likely to pay premium prices. Rising pet ownership during the pandemic benefitted producers, and expanded disposable income enabled higher pet spending despite easing pet numbers post-pandemic. However, spiking input costs like corn and soybeans led to higher selling prices. Over the past five years, revenue grew at a 2.0% CAGR and is expected to reach $75.2 billion in 2024, dipping 1.2%.",
