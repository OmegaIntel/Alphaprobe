    "executive_summary": "The industry consists of various noncommercial markets, mainly healthcare, educational, religious, governmental and recreational facilities. Government funding accounts for almost all educational and public building construction, while the private sector funds most healthcare and religious constructions. Local and state government investment has inched down; at the same time, as states paid out millions of unemployment insurance claims during the pandemic, tax revenue and government investment shifted away from construction projects. Skyrocketing interest rates, coupled with a declining value of nonresidential construction, have also made it less profitable to start new construction projects. Revenue has dropped at an expected CAGR of 0.2% to $243.0 billion through the current period, despite an expected 3.3% jump in 2024 alone as government investment has rebounded.",

Revenue swelled, outstripping dwindling contracts from other markets. Input prices increased significantly after supply chain disruptions, pressuring profit down to 2.6%. Contractors will benefit from expected lower interest rates and more contract availability as economic conditions improve. Revenue will climb at 1.0% CAGR to $254.8B in 2029. While nonessential building construction slowed during the pandemic, demand for healthcare and public safety facilities skyrocketed, carrying industry growth."

Following inflation, the Fed raised interest rates multiple times through 2022-2024, discouraging new projects. Building material prices also grew expensive. The Russian invasion added uncertainty. Crude oil volatility increased construction costs. It's become difficult to hire skilled labor, so companies use more subcontracted labor to reduce payroll costs. Subcontractors provide flexibility to hire temporary local workforces."

Instead, contractors have opted to use subcontracted labor, increasing purchase costs. Subcontractors are paid only until a project is completed, reducing a contractor's annual payroll. Subcontractors give companies flexibility to compete across the US and hire temporary local workforces. Smaller companies form development consortiums to bid for larger contracts together."

Regulators have placed a greater emphasis on sustainability in construction practices. Contractors can receive tax incentives for obtaining LEED certifications.",

            "question": "How does your company hedge against economic downturn?",
            "answer": "Demand for municipal construction will typically follow the general business cycle. Amid an economic downturn, countercyclical budgetary action will support demand for municipal construction projects. However, revenue will mostly follow trends in state and local government budgets since they are the main clients."
        },
        {
            "question": "How does your company protect itself from market risk?",
            "answer": "Specialized companies may have a superior reputation, increasing sales. Nondiversified companies may experience greater revenue volatility, hurting future earnings. Overall, companies that cater to a diverse range of downstream projects will be less volatile and less exposed to market risk."
        },
        {
            "question": "Is your company located in close proximity to buying and selling markets?",
            "answer": "Companies located in proximity to upstream suppliers will exhibit lower purchase costs and greater profitability. Companies located not in proximity to end markets will have higher transportation costs, hindering profitability. The overall structure of the industry necessitates that operations be fragmented geographically since it is uncompetitive to offer services outside a specific range."
        },
        {
            "question": "Has your company contended with volatile input prices?",
            "answer": "Companies that enter into long-term supply agreements with suppliers can protect themselves from future input price increases, protecting themselves from upside risk."
        },
        {
            "question": "How is your company leveraging the latest technologies?",
            "answer": "Companies using the latest technologies will exhibit higher operational efficiencies and wider profit. Drones have become a viable commercial technology for municipal building construction contractors via the Federal Aviation Administration's legalization of using commercial drones. Overall, using them to scope out job sites, heat maps and 3D models are some examples of using this labor-saving technology."
        },
        {
            "question": "Has your company been able to reduce wage costs via technology?",
            "answer": "Companies with the latest technologies will be more price-competitive because of labor cost savings. However, wage costs can be most easily reduced via the subcontracting of nonessential employees as well as only keeping specialized employees on the books full-time."
        },
        {
            "question": "Is your company prepared to meet shifting environmental standards?",
            "answer": "Companies with an environmentally friendly reputation may be preferred by the public, increasing sales volumes. Noncompliant companies will be subject to fines and penalties, reducing profitability. With potential shifts to environmental regulations could cause municipal building construction contractors to exhibit an increase in operating costs. More specifically, since this is a publicly funded industry, public authorities may not be able to accept bids from non-compliant contractors."
        },
        {
            "question": "How does your company ensure all occupational health and safety requirements are upheld?",
            "answer": "Companies with a proven reputation for safety may be favored in the contract tender process. Noncompliant companies will exhibit insurance premium cost increases, reducing profit."
        },
        {
            "question": "How does your company's profit margin compare to those of your competitors?",
            "answer": "Companies using the latest technologies will have higher operational efficiencies and wider profit. Companies that engage in long-term supply management will have lower purchase costs and greater profitability. Companies must serve to differentiate themselves from their competition via a strong reputation for quality and under-budget projects. Since contractors are publicly-funded, the least cost is of critical importance in order to win contracts."
        },
        {
            "question": "Does your company experience any difficulty financing current operations?",
            "answer": "Most construction projects are financed by credit or debt and rising interest rates will inhibit borrowing to fund current operations. Countercyclical budget action by the federal government can increase funding in times of economic downturn. It is important to note that revenue from projects is not realized until after completion, requiring significant cash reserves and steady cashflow to see companies through periods of depressed demand."
        },
        {
            "question": "How often do you subcontract industry activities? Do you regularly enlist the help of independent operators and consultants?",
            "answer": "It is essential that contractors ensure proper resource allocation and rectify issues that may arise during any given stage of a project. Via the subcontracting of less essential tasks, municipal building construction contractors are able to keep cashflow free for any unexpected budget items."
        },
        {
            "question": "More so in public rather than private tenders, how do you ensure the lowest price for a bid to be awarded a contract? How are you able to offer low prices?",
            "answer": "Much of the work generated by this industry is awarded by public tender, so operators must have a proven capacity to compete by offering the lowest price. Typically since government institutions are financially constrained, offers of the lowest price will generally be more favorable in this industry rather than in adjacent construction industries."
        },
        {
            "question": "Do you have a good relationship with your subcontractors? How do you assess which subcontractors you do business with?",
            "answer": "Contractors' heavy reliance on subcontracted labor makes it essential for them to maintain good relationships with a pool of skilled subcontractors."
        },
        {
            "question": "Is your company prepared to adapt to rising long-term interest rates? Does your company track interest rates closely?",
            "answer": "As the yield and interest rates rise, municipal building contractors in both the public and private sectors will exhibit increases in borrowing costs, limiting demand for new projects."
        },
        {
            "question": "Do you monitor population trends? How does the growth of the US population affect demand for your services?",
            "answer": "A larger US population creates a greater need for municipal buildings like schools, hospitals and other public facilities. This translates into greater revenue for the industry, as more buildings must be built to accommodate the growing population."
        },
        {
            "question": "Does your company rely overwhelmingly on public funds?",
            "answer": "<UNKNOWN>"

        {
            "question": "Does your company do a lot of work with local and state governments?",
            "answer": "As local and state government investment increases, so does spending on municipal building construction."
