    "executive_summary": "Prominent musical productions dominate live performance theaters, which have prospered over the past five years. Still, the nature of live performance theaters allows for various live performances that appeal to every consumer preference. Boundless opportunities exist for artistic innovation and success as long as consumers can enjoy nonessential experiences. The outbreak of COVID-19 completely upended live performances when theaters nationwide had to shut down for over a year. Deserted theaters reversed growth for live performance theaters, with industry-wide revenue falling at a CAGR of 10.4% over the past five years and is expected to total $5.7 billion in 2024, when revenue will contract by an estimated 0.01%.",

Consumer preferences have favored shows with simple sets and powerful stories instead of over-the-top, costly shows, leaving many expensive productions unable to recoup.

Many donors today are more inclined to support climate, racial and social justice sectors over the arts, leading to limited funding for artists and theaters. With limited support and falling attendance, more theaters may be forced to cut staff to reduce costs, affecting the quality and quantity of productions. A few theaters, specifically those that are smaller or operate as non-profits, will be forced to shut their doors over the next few years as the financial difficulties become too great."

Consumers are drawn to these embellished and expensive performances, allowing theaters to hike prices. As theaters attempt to attract larger audiences and justify higher ticket prices, marketing and purchase costs will rise. The rising use of technologically advanced equipment has and will continue to push up depreciation costs. These growing costs can hinder profit growth over the outlook period."
