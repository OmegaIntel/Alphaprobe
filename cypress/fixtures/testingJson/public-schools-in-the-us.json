    "executive_summary": "Public schools include traditional elementary (kindergarten through fifth grade), middle (sixth through eighth grade) and high schools (ninth through 12th grade), in addition to charter and magnet schools. Public schools' revenue depends on government funding from tax revenue and borrowing. Over the past five years, disruptions from the COVID-19 pandemic have been supplemented by strong growth amid recovery, but lingering difficulties from rising interest rates will temper growth moving forward. Falling birth rates are also threatening the long-term health of the industry as fewer young students replace graduating seniors.",
