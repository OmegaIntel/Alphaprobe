    "executive_summary": "The after-school program industry has faced significant challenges due to changing lifestyles and economic headwinds. The rise of remote work has allowed many parents to care for their children after school, reducing the need for external care. Inflation has also reduced disposable incomes, forcing families to cut non-essential expenses like after-school programs. Despite declining unemployment rates, an expected uptick in unemployment by 2024 will further decrease demand as jobless parents can care for their children themselves. However, federal support for after-school programs has helped slow the industry's decline. Revenue has been dropping at a CAGR of 3.3% to an estimated $20.9 billion through 2024, including an expected 1.3% dip in 2024 alone.",
