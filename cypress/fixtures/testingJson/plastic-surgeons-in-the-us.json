    "executive_summary": "The aging population and increasingly favorable public perception of plastic surgery have driven demand for the Plastic Surgery industry over the five years to 2023. Technological advances have bolstered growth as safer and less-expensive procedures have become available to consumers. While the COVID-19 pandemic intercepted strong economic conditions that better enabled consumers to pay for plastic surgery, many consumers benefited from the injection of government stimulus into the economy, lifting per capita disposable income. The pandemic also enabled consumers with remote work routines to recover without taking time off, fueling rapid growth in 2020 and 2021.",

Even as the COVID-19 pandemic ravaged the economy in 2020, many consumers benefited from the injection of government stimulus into the economy, lifting per capita disposable income in 2020 and 2021. Along with rising per capita disposable income levels, plastic surgery demand has benefited from rising total health expenditure and a growing population, expanding the industry's potential client base."

With more celebrities and public figures coming forward about going under the knife, the social acceptability of cosmetic surgery has increased throughout the consumer market. A rise in cosmetic surgeries from the aging baby-boomer generation has followed, with its desire to preserve youth and health."

These types of surgeries are heavily reliant on consumers' economic situations because they are either financed or paid for directly by the client. With more financing now available for elective cosmetic surgery, there are greater options for flexible patient-client payment programs to undertake plastic surgery."

Practices now contended with rising competition from medical spas and clinics offering Botox injections, laser hair removal and alternative nonsurgical cosmetic procedures. Nonsurgical procedures have experienced significant growth during the past decade because the FDA approved of Botox, which temporarily reduces signs of wrinkles."

The rise in disposable income is important for this industry because many procedures performed by plastic surgeons are elective. Clients must finance the surgery or pay for it out-of-pocket.

According to the American Society for Aesthetic Plastic Surgery, two of the top five most-common surgical procedures performed by plastic surgeons are obesity-related: liposuction and abdominoplasty. Since Americans' focus on weight and dieting is not likely to change drastically, more consumers are expected to perceive these surgeries as viable options for weight loss, particularly as prices decline."

Nonsurgical procedures are projected to outpace more-traditional plastic surgery over the next five years. Even with plastic surgery advances, nonsurgical products' subtler and less costly changes have wide appeal. However, plastic surgeons will likely benefit from a further increase in regulation for medical spas."

The outlook period will favor the development of large multispecialty practices primarily because of their greater leverage in negotiating payments with managed-care organizations.
