    "executive_summary": "Climbing gyms have enjoyed modest growth over the current period but have endured considerable volatility. Following the outbreak of COVID-19, social distancing measures and temporary closures led to massive revenue declines. Nonetheless, the number of climbing gyms increased by 44 in 2020, with only 18 permanently closing, according to 2021 data from the Climbing Business Journal. Pent-up demand led to a massive recovery for climbing gyms in 2021 as gyms reopened, even amid reduced capacities. The introduction of climbing at the Olympics led to an uptick in interest in climbing, greatly benefitting the recovery of climbing gyms. The number of new visitors has increased over the current period, propping up growth. Revenue has been increasing at a CAGR of 0.7% to total an estimated $580.1 million in 2024, including an estimated increase of 0.7% in 2024 alone.",
