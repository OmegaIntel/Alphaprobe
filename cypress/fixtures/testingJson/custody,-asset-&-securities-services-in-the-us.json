Since industry servicers generate fees based on the value of their holdings of AUC, growing asset prices benefit the broader industry. This consistent trend withstood volatile events such as the COVID-19 pandemic and enabled high market trading volumes."

Market liquidity has remained elevated, even as the COVID-19 pandemic occurred. Although the economy endured volatility, favorable fiscal conditions in the form of low interest rates and a dovish stance from the Federal Reserve fueled continuous trading activity, boosting AUC performance. Even as trading activity bolstered revenue growth, processing fees from trades across the markets slipped due to automation of trade reconciliation, dampening growth for industry servicers."

Some US custodians have aggressively expanded into foreign markets such as Europe, Asia and the Middle East to take advantage of the developing financial sectors within these geographic markets, aiming to expand outreach toward global markets and consumers. The expansion of regulations onto downstream financial industries accelerated the industry's push toward areas traditionally occupied by larger financial firms, fueling alternative sources of revenue and shifting business strategy in tandem with prime brokers."

Although assets under custody (AUC) holdings will continue to grow in tandem with strong macroeconomic performance, industry servicers will have to cope with a more hawkish Federal Reserve, as rising interest rates to combat inflation will dampen the performance of certain AUC. Nonetheless, strong corporate performance coupled with broader economic growth will overshadow interest rate hikes and enable steady growth for the industry."

As industry servicers continue to diversify their service offerings, technological advancement will be a key driver of growth in this sphere, with the growth of data management, electronic trading platforms and analytics programs exemplifying this trend. Although broader fiduciary services related to AUC holdings will remain a core component of revenue, the acceleration into alternative functions previously taken by central securities depositories and downstream industries will diversify the industry's business strategy and strengthen the industry\u2019s growth."

This trend is already taking effect, with internationalized custodian banks beginning to move some of their business processes toward global markets in Asia and Eastern Europe. These regions offer lower operational costs and newfound opportunities for AUC growth. As international markets continue to grow their financial sectors' footprint, it will lead to increased retail trading abroad, generating higher trading volumes and fee revenue for relevant industry servicers.

The most significant law impacting the industry is the 2010 Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform & Consumer Protection Act (the Dodd-Frank Act), which regulates the financial sector and influences oversight on core financial services. With industry servicers looking to preserve profit, increased federal regulation will accelerate the industry's push abroad to developing markets, highlighting a change in industry operations. Although the Dodd-Frank Act endured a rollback in 2018 from Congress that influenced smaller banks and industry servicers, broader financial regulations remain in place, influencing industry behavior moving forward."

            "answer": "The majority of industry income is based on the value of assets under custody (AUC). AUC is generally related to the inflow of funds and appreciation of assets within mutual funds, retirement savings accounts and collective investment schemes. When the personal savings rate declines, revenue can be generated from dealing in financing related to securities. By creating a diversified revenue stream, the industry is protected from sudden changes in the fiscal capabilities of ordinary consumers and provides a pivot opportunity towards other potential revenue streams."

            "question": "How will higher interest rates affect the assets in your portfolio? What measures do you take when interest rates rise?",
            "answer": "Demand for industry services largely depends on the health of the bond market, due to transaction fees and income derived from asset valuations. An increase in interest rates negatively affects the stock market which declines assets' value and decreases trading volume. Advising clients during an interest rate hike on how to benefit from this situation can help offset losses."

            "answer": "The Standard & Poor's 500 index (S&P 500) is a price-weighted index of the 500 large-cap common stocks held in the United States. Increase in S&P 500 increases trading volume which increases revenue generated from transaction fees. However, any increases in trading volume does not change the fees charged per trade. This always remains constant depending on the nature of the trade."
