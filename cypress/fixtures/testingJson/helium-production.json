    "executive_summary": "This Helium Production industry is comprised of a small number of operators that produce helium in compressed, liquid and solid forms, supplying it to a diverse range of downstream customers across chemical, metals and energy refining, manufacturing, healthcare and food and beverage industries. Over the five years to 2022, industry operators have relied on strong demand from these downstream markets in addition to international demand to weather volatile conditions. In particular, demand from high-tech manufacturing operations that use helium in components such as semiconductors has buoyed demand, with exports increasing an annualized 1.2% to $446.2 million over the five years to 2022. This has helped the industry manage the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, which have periodically shuttered establishments, dramatically reduced demand from healthcare and food and beverage operators, and resulted in revenue falling 25.2% in 2020 alone. Consequently, industry revenue is projected to grow an annualized 2.2% to $942.5 million over the five years to 2022, including an increase of 29.2% in 2022 alone.",
