In addition, e-discovery services enable companies to process and compile data, which can be used in litigation or government investigations. Over the past five years, consumers and businesses' rapidly increasing use of digital systems has spurred demand for services, albeit interrupted by a decline in demand because of a decline in corporate profit in 2020 amid the pandemic. Over the past five years, revenue has grown at a CAGR of 3.2% to $6.1 billion, including an expected 3.2% increase in 2023. Profit is expected to slump to 6.4% of revenue in 2023 from 6.7% in 2018.",
