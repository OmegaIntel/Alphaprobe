Travel may be between private or public airports and may involve regular or irregular service. During this period, the industry faced volatile economic conditions, which reduced demand from passengers traveling for both corporate and leisure purposes. Heightened e-commerce activity amid the pandemic partially insulated the industry from COVID-related declines in 2020. Although the pandemic ultimately hindered revenue, pent-up demand supports a strong recovery for the industry. Overall, industry revenue increased by a CAGR of 0.7% to $30.7 billion over the five years to 2024, including a slight increase of 0.9% in 2024 alone.",
