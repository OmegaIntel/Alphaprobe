    "executive_summary": "Economic performance and construction activity are two major factors influencing growth for interior designers. Residential and commercial markets are interior designers' vital downstream markets. While both markets adjust spending on interior design based on changes in economic activity, the mix of residential and commercial designers balances the effect on the industry. For instance, positive trends in consumer spending and the housing market over the past five years have offset shakier activity in the nonresidential sphere. Rising consumer spending in recent years has benefited independent designers, the bulk of the profession, as homeowners spent more on interior design. In all, industry-wide revenue has been expanding at a CAGR of 2.9% to an estimated $25.9 billion over the past five years, including an anticipated 2.9% boost in 2024.",
