An array of downstream industries in the manufacturing and construction sectors use ferrous metal foundry products. These markets were weakened at the start of the current period due to declining industrial activity. In addition, fluctuating raw material prices have contributed to a rising level of revenue volatility. Also, the industry has recently struggled to maintain growth and profit during the systematic shock to economic activity and global trade stemming from the pandemic.",

Foundries will attempt to pass higher input costs onto customers. The world price of iron ore and the price of steel, which form a significant portion of industry expenses, are notoriously volatile and challenging for manufacturers to manage. The world price of iron ore has increased through 2024 because of the significant appetite for iron from rapidly developing nations, namely India and China."

The value of residential construction has declined despite solid growth in 2020, as people can't fund new projects. In addition, housing starts have lagged in the latter part of the period due to rising interest rates. Similarly, the value of nonresidential construction crashed during the pandemic as office vacancies rose. Rising interest rates make new construction projects unprofitable even as individuals return to work."

Similar to the construction markets, substitute materials, like aluminum, have grown popular. Iron and steel casting are often heavier and less malleable than alternatives. As automotive manufacturers produce lighter bodies to hit fuel efficiency targets, this critical source of revenue will wane."

These include products with complex shapes, greater core complexities, tighter dimensional tolerances and specialty-grade corrosion-resistant steels. These parts often require a high degree of technical collaboration with customers and flexible lead times that are less vulnerable to price competition.

The Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA) will provide funding for updates and new facilities by the construction sector, specifically utilities construction. Also, public support for cleaner and more sustainable alternatives will result in new plants and facilities.

Domestic companies will jump at the opportunity to expand their presence into foreign markets, fulfilling supply shortfalls and raising competition among manufacturers to sway international customers in major export destinations, including Mexico and Canada. Even so, many downstream markets have opted for offshore production. As these customers move abroad, they will source inputs from nearby suppliers in foreign markets instead of domestic foundries."

            "question": "How have volatile steel prices affected your company's financial performance? Are you positioned to take advantage of falling steel prices over the coming years?",
            "answer": "When steel prices climb, manufacturers may be able to pass on some of the higher costs to customers. However, depending on an item's specific price elasticity, companies may not be able to fully offset the increase in cost with an increase in its final selling price, negatively affecting profit. Conversely, when iron and steel prices fall, this may hurt a company's top-line performance if they are unable to generate new sales. However, lower input costs can lead to wider profitability if the company can sustain its current price structure."
