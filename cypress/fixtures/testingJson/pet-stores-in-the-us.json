Pet parents have increasingly lavished their pets with premium food products, designer pet accessories and luxury grooming services. The industry has expanded despite mounting competition from supermarkets, mass merchandisers and online retailers. These competitors offer similar products at greater convenience and competitive prices. Traditional brick-and-mortar stores have successfully positioned themselves as pioneers and exclusive providers of high-quality food and additional service offerings, like grooming or daycare.",

Small retailers often compete by catering to a specific niche market within a regional area. These small stores endured competition from internal big-box retailers and external competitors, such as mass merchandisers, supermarkets and online retailers.
