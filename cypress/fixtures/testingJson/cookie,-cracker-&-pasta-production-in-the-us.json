Nonetheless, diets that cut out carbohydrates and wheat-based goods have stifled growth significantly. Conversely, the rise of popular cooking TV shows and other content has made younger generations expansively purchase their pasta, baking mixes and dough to prepare meals and desserts at home. Although boosted disposable income through the end of 2023 has allowed consumers to upgrade to more premium brands and varieties, it has also allowed consumers to purchase a broader range of alternative products.",
