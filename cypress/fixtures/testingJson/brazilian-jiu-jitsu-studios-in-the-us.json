Social distancing measures prevented BJJ studios from practicing because of the hands-on nature of the sport. Following the reopening of the economy and vaccine rollouts, pent-up demand led to solid growth in 2021. Still, BJJ studios did not fully recover because of the difficulty in gaining back customers they had lost. Nonetheless, growth in total recreation expenditure enabled BJJ studios to recover over the current period.",
