During the period, growth in consumer spending drove demand for these services, while a rising prime rate drove up the cost of (and therefore revenue generated by) industry services, resulting in revenue growth. The industry experienced declines in revenue in 2020 and 2021 as it faced depressed consumer demand and a lower prime rate due to the pandemic. The industry returned to growth in 2022 as consumer spending climbed and the prime rate was raised to combat inflation.",

Low interest rates make it cheaper for consumers to borrow money to finance a car purchase. Low interest rates also make it more attractive for consumers to choose financing options such as car loans over paying cash for a vehicle. This can be beneficial for auto financing companies as it can result in increased revenue from loan origination and servicing fees."

If the Federal Reserve stops raising rates too soon and inflation fears take root, the economy might spiral into hyperinflation, likely negatively affecting revenue for auto financing companies. High inflation would also make it more expensive for companies to borrow money, which could lead to higher interest rates on loans and leases."

In a recession, consumers may be more hesitant to take on new debt, such as a car loan or lease, making it harder for auto financing companies to attract customers. Companies may also face increased default rates on loans and leases, as more customers struggle to make their payments."
