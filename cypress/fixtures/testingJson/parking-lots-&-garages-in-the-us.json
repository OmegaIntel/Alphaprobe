    "executive_summary": "Figures have been adjusted for inflation and are presented in 2023 currency. Parking lots and garages have struggled with diminishing revenue over the last few years as the outbreak of COVID-19 depleted economic activity and consumers' parking needs. The Federal Reserve's aggressive interest rate hikes throughout 2022 and 2023 has resulted in tightened budgets and decreased disposable income, suppressing demand for parking services at commercial facilities. Revenue has fallen at a CAGR of 5.1% over the past five years, and is expected to total $9.4 billion. A sharp decline in the world price of oil will contribute an estimated rise of 4.3% in 2023, when profit is projected to rise.",

            "current_performance_point_description": "Economic uncertainty has led to a decline in car ownership as consumers seek cost-effective alternatives like ride-sharing and public transportation, reducing the demand for parking spaces. The hike in remote work and e-commerce popularity has substantially affected traditional retail businesses, reducing consumer parking demand as onsite shopping decreases in favor of online shopping. The Federal Reserve's aggressive rate hikes in 2022-2023 led to a budget squeeze and less disposable income. In response, demand for parking lots and garage services fell as individuals turned to cheaper, accident-avoiding transportation alternatives. Supply-chain disruptions resulting from the pandemic lead to a spike in the cost of a new or used car, contributing to lower rates of car ownership."

            "current_performance_point_description": "Parking lot and garage companies increasingly use management contracts to streamline operations, reduce overhead, comply with regulations and avoid ownership or construction-related costs and work. Management contracts shift liability and operational risks away from a client to the contracted firm. Business owners can focus on their core operations without worrying about parking facility management challenges. Outsourcing parking services through management contracts has become more common as residential, commercial and manufacturing facilities seek to specialize in their own businesses. Nonresidential construction in urban areas has also boosted the popularity of management contracts, particularly in the context of mixed-use developments."

Online shopping will continue expanding since e-commerce platforms often offer a wider selection of products and services than physical stores and offer competitive pricing, incentivizing consumers to shop online instead of in-store. The pandemic also promoted remote learning and working, with many workplaces and educational facilities continuing to offer remote opportunities despite widespread vaccination. A reduction in commuter rates will leave parking lots emptier."

A surge in consumer confidence will encourage air and car travel, thereby spurring demand for parking services. A mild boost in construction activity will benefit parking companies, enabling them to expand when new commercial or residential facilities are constructed. The number of businesses is set to swell in the coming years, bolstering demand for parking lots and workplace garages. Total retail sales will rise as well, indicating demand from commercial markets. The world price of oil is set to fall consistently in the next few years, enabling car ownership among consumers who have less disposable income."

Consumers are increasingly advocating for safer bike lanes and bike-sharing programs to encourage environmentally friendly alternatives to driving in their communities. As environmental awareness grows, consumers will be more inclined to use public transportation and other alternatives to driving, reducing demand for parking services."

Armed with more information, mobile app users will be able to choose alternative modes of transportation when traffic is heavy or compare prices across garages, boosting price competition. Some parking lot companies will use mobile apps to their advantage by integrating the platforms into their parking services, connecting drivers with available spots in real time. Garages will also embrace dynamic pricing made possible through mobile apps' data, enabling parking companies to inflate prices when demand is high."
