Perfume and fragrance products are discretionary items, and as a result, they are highly sensitive to fluctuations in both disposable income and consumer confidence. Industry revenue has stalled over the past five years, thanks to diminished consumer confidence, fluctuating disposable income and increasing price competition among operators.",
