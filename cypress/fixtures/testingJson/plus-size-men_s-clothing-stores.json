    "executive_summary": "The Plus-Size Men's Clothing Stores industry sells apparel tailored for men with a waist size of over 40 inches or men that are over six feet two inches tall, usually referred to as big and tall men's clothing. As a result, industry demand is partly correlated with trends in the obesity rate. According to the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Disease, the percentage of American men that are overweight or obese remains over 70.0%, which has expanded the industry's core market. However, the majority of purchases of plus-size clothing occurs outside of the industry through a variety of more-popular channels, including e-commerce websites, department stores, mass merchandisers and wholesale clubs. Consequently, industry revenue has declined at an annualized rate of 3.6% to $848.9 million over the five years to 2021. In 2021 alone, industry revenue is estimated to rebound 2.8% due to an increase in consumer spending as industry establishments slowly reopen with the necessary precautions to prevent the spread of the COVID-19 (coronavirus) pandemic.",
