These downstream markets comprise well over eighty percent of the demand for court reporting services,, these two markets are highly indicative of industry performance in a given year. COVID-19 disruptions caused several issues for court reporters. In many industries, COVID closures meant that businesses held off on mergers and acquisition moves, which would slow demand from the business sector. On that same note, a slowdown in business ventures also harmed banking institutions, causing them to pull back on advisory roles on deals. This chain of events led to a severely diminished demand for court reporters in 2020. A stable stream of demand came in the form of online government hearings. During the same year, the",

This issue stems primarily from two contributors: the high qualification standards required for prospective stenographers and a significant wave of retirements in the stenographer workforce. The shortage was brewing before the onset of the pandemic; however, COVID-19 has significantly exacerbated the situation."

Local, state and national courts stayed busy by hosting online trials, keeping court reporters employed as a result. Despite this spark of hope, revenue generated by court reporters services is still expected to fall at an annualized CAGR of 2.0% to $4,166.5 million over the five years to 2024, with a 4.7% decrease during the year, when profit is expected to fall to 10.6%. During the next period, several economic trends are set to oppose each other. While corporate profit and business demand are set to grow, opposingly, divorce, crime and incarceration rates are expected to fall, running counter to the growth in the business sectors. As a result, revenue for court reporter services is anticipated to fall at an estimated CAGR of 4.6% to $3,300.6 million. Artificial intelligence capabilities are also expected to seep into the industry, creating an additional problem that operators must address. AI worries have grown, but experts reiterate that AI will be an addition to court reporters, honed to make a more effective service."
