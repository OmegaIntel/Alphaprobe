    "executive_summary": "Figures have been adjusted for inflation and are presented in 2021 currency.\n\nRevenue for the Office Furniture Rental industry has trended upward over the five years to 2021. Operators in this industry rent and lease office furniture, such as tables, chairs, desks and cabinets, to businesses and government institutions. The industry is driven by a wide range of macroeconomic factors, such as the number of businesses operating domestically and the unemployment rate, both of which are expected to improve during the five-year period. Growth in the number of businesses stimulates demand for office furniture, and thus industry revenue. Moreover, for the majority of the period, the unemployment rate fell, increasing demand for office furniture, as businesses require furniture for new employees. Due to these positive trends, IBISWorld expects industry revenue to grow an annualized 4.1% to $1.1 billion over the five years to 2021, including growth of 9.5% in 2021 alone. Additionally, the COVID-19 (coronavirus) pandemic is expected to have mixed effects on the industry, with revenue increasing an estimated 1.0% in 2020 alone.",

            "current_performance_point_description": "In addition to the previously mentioned trends, interest rates have been historically low over the past five years. Although low interest rates encourage businesses to lease office furniture to take advantage of lower financing costs, they also inhibit profit growth, as the monthly leasing payment made by businesses is reduced. This particularly affected potential new entrants, who are less able to weather fluctuations in monthly leasing payments. As a result, profit decreased during the period despite growth in revenue and overall demand."

            "current_performance_point_description": "Over the five years to 2026, revenue is anticipated to continue rising, albeit at a slower pace, bolstered by continued growth in the number of businesses. Growth in the number of businesses will increase the industry's downstream market size and thus provide a greater pool of businesses for operators to service. In the past, businesses decided to rent or lease furniture to maintain financial flexibility, particularly during periods of economic uncertainty. Therefore, as the coronavirus pandemic continues to evolve, businesses are expected to increasingly opt to rent furniture to avoid several costs associated with owning and maintaining furniture, such as transportation, storage and restoration expenses. To this end, industry revenue is expected to rise an annualized 1.4% to $1.2 billion over the next five years."

The coronavirus significantly disrupted the economy in 2020, causing the number of businesses to decrease and the national unemployment rate to surge. Poor economic conditions are expected to have had an initial negative affect on the industry. However, the transition to work from home operations for many businesses and workers throughout the country, is expected to represent a potential opportunity for the industry. Due to the uncertainty of the environment surrounding the coronavirus pandemic, many consumers are inclined to rent office furniture rather than purchase, as it requires less of a long-term commitment. This is appealing to many businesses and workers as the coronavirus continues to evolve and the future remains uncertain. Nonetheless, the initial negative affects of the pandemic are expected to limit growth in 2020. Overall, industry revenue is expected to increase 1.0% in 2020 alone. However, as businesses adjust to the changing climate and work from home operations continue for many workers, industry revenue is expected to increase significantly in 2021 as renting office furniture continues to gain popularity. As a result, industry revenue is expected to increase 9.5% in 2021 alone."

            "future_outlook_point_description": "Profit for the Office Furniture Rental industry is anticipated to trend slightly lower over the five years to 2026, despite the aforementioned revenue growth. Industry profit will experience continued downward pressure from external and internal competition, due to the rising number of operators entering this industry. To this end, the number of enterprises is forecast to increase at annualized rate of 2.1% to 152 operators over the five years to 2026. This increase in enterprises, combined with a renewed focus on hiring skilled workers in a competitive environment will keep wages rising at an annualized rate of 1.9% to $274.2 million over the next five years. However, this decline in profit margins will likely be tempered by rising interest rates, particularly for rent-to-own furniture services. Although rising interest rates will temper demand, as the affordability of financing furniture rentals decreases, they also provide a boost to profit margins. As interest rates increase, industry operators will be able to raise their lease equivalent rate or lease rate factor. Consequently, industry operators will receive greater interest payments, bolstering profit margins despite their overall decline."

However, they are still substantial, as large businesses that are expanding may choose to rent, instead of own, when expansion efforts are still in their fledgling stages. In addition, some larger companies with smaller profit margins may still choose to rent furniture even when they are more established, due to the substantial upfront costs of new furniture for a larger organization.",

            "question": "What, if any, portions of your business experience increased demand during periods of slow economic growth?",
            "answer": "In times of economic downturn, some companies choose to rent instead of buy due to reduced cash on hand."

            "question": "Have you had any regulatory expenses that have significantly impacted profitability recently?",
            "answer": "The main regulations in this industry are regarding rent-to-own operations and, in some states, limiting the maximum rental price compared to retail. Coronavirus related regulations may include social distancing, mask mandates and increased cleaning and sanitation procedures.

        },

            "question": "How do you make sure your prices are attractive to customers? Do you monitor changes in regulation?",
            "answer": "Ensuring pricing policy is appropriate. Industry operators provide products that act as perfect substitutes for each other. Consequently, competitive pricing plays an important role in maintaining and increasing sales. The COVID-19 (coronavirus) pandemic is expected to increase the importance of competitive pricing as individuals and businesses seek to cut costs."

            "question": "Is your company located near your suppliers? How much money do you spend on transporting furniture from the suppliers to your company?",

            "question": "Do you monitor the yield on the 10-year Treasury note to plan your business accordingly? How have rising interest rates affected your company?",
            "answer": "The yield on the 10-year Treasury note is typically synonymous with overall market interest rates. As interest rates trend lower, businesses are more likely to lease furniture due to the reduction in financing costs. Low interest rates stimulate demand, and thus industry revenue. In 2020, the yield on the 10-year Treasury note decreased significantly in response to the COVID-19 (coronavirus) pandemic. Conversely, in 2021, it is expected to increase sharply."
