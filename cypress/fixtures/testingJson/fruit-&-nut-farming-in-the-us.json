        {
            "question": "How does your company hedge against price loss risk?",
            "answer": "Most farms grow several crops in an effort to diversify while switching cropping activities to suit market conditions is also a viable strategy. A diverse range of crops helps to protect farmers from price fluctuations, insulating operators against downturns in one specific commodity."
        },
        {
            "question": "Does your company place an emphasis on growing organic produce?",
            "answer": "Organic produce trades at a significant premium, sometimes in excess of 200.0% of non-organic counterparts. This will garner higher revenue per sale. Consumer demand for organic fruits and nuts has grown sharply over the past five years."
        },
        {
            "question": "How does your company handle potential market risk?",
            "answer": "- Farms that enter into contract growing will be less likely to be harmed by adverse events causing end-market activity to decline since they are contracted for a specific quantity and value of industrial products. - Farms that primarily sell to one specific end-market may exhibit higher returns but will also take on greater market risk."
        },
        {
            "question": "How does your company control for environmental factors of production?",
            "answer": "- Some crops are extremely temperamental and will not be viable without sufficient water, heat and light. - Growing crops under cover may incur more upfront expense, but this will allow growers total control over their crops' growing climate."
        },
        {
            "question": "Has your company engaged in the use of commercial drones in operations?",
            "answer": "With the Federal Aviation Administration's authorization of the use of commercial drones, farmers have been leveraging drones to monitor and adjust crop nutrient levels, reducing labor needs and increasing profitability."
        },
        {
            "question": "Has your farm sought to reduce labor costs via seasonal labor?",
            "answer": "Some crops are too delicate to be harvested by machine and necessitate the use of labor to harvest by hand. Overall, seasonal labor can be employed to lower labor costs when and where necessary."
        },
        {
            "question": "How does your company ensure it meets all organic certifications and qualifications?",
            "answer": "Organic produce trades at a significant premium, while it is also highly illegal to sell falsified organic produce, which will incur steep fines and penalties from the United States Department of Agriculture."
        },
        {
            "question": "How does your company ensure it is following all legal restrictions and legislation?",
            "answer": "Potential reforms to the HB1 visa program may make it more difficult to hire seasonal labor on an as-needed basis. As it becomes more difficult to hire seasonal labor, costs for industry products will rise."
        },
        {
            "question": "How does your company ensure profitability in volatile and turbulent market conditions? Has your company had any difficulty financing current operations?",
            "answer": "Most agricultural producers produce at a loss and do not make a profit until government payments are factored in. However, government payments as a share of net farm income have been growing."
        },
        {
            "question": "How does your company keep depreciation charges low?",
            "answer": "Through the rental of equipment on an as-needed basis, small-scale farms can keep depreciation charges low vis the renting of equipment. This will keep cashflow freed up and allow for greater profitability."
        },
        {
            "question": "Does your company have contracts for international sales?",
            "answer": "Securing export market contracts allows farmers to temper the effects of domestic demand fluctuations. Effectively, as more fruit and nuts are exported, domestic supply tightens and prices rise."
        },
        {
            "question": "How do you ensure the health and viability of your crops?",
            "answer": "The presence of fertile soils and other appropriate growing conditions plays a critical role in shaping the success of growing fruit and nuts because they influence harvest volumes and crop quality. Some fruits such as avocados are extremely temperamental and require the strictest of growing conditions, often incurring significant costs in the form of irrigation and pollination."
        },
        {
            "question": "How does your company grow operations?",
            "answer": "Economies of scale in production generate cost savings for fruit and nut growers. Specifically, economies of scale result in lower per-unit costs that ultimately result in higher net returns."
        },
        {
            "question": "Does your company sell grapes to wineries?",
            "answer": "Grapes alone account for a large portion of industry revenue, many of these sales being to wineries. Since wines require specific grapes, this product segment is one of the industry's highest-margin segments due to the limited production of grapes by type."
        },
        {
            "question": "Exports account for the plurality of industry revenue by end-market. Facing turbulent international demand conditions, how does your company ensure consistent export sales?",
            "answer": "A significant portion of industry revenue is derived from exports. As export conditions deteriorate, the domestic market floods and drives prices down as export sales and revenue decline."
        },
        {
            "question": "How much of your product goes to canned fruit and vegetable processors?",
            "answer": "Though a significant portion of industry fruits are destined for the processing market, the processing market is substantially less profitable than is the fresh produce market. Fresh produce trades at a premium, while less attractive produce is typically sent to the lower-value processing market."
