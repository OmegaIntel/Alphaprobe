Volatility in the world price of steel has translated into sharp swings in industry revenue over the five years to 2021. Additionally, demand for industry products declined significantly in 2020, as the COVID-19 (coronavirus) pandemic sharply reduced demand for restaurants. Overall, industry revenue is expected to increase at an annualized rate of 0.7% to $4.1 billion, including growth of 15.3% in 2021 as the coronavirus pandemic is expected to abate in the United States, leading to a forecast economic recovery.",

            "question": "How is your company impacted by rising imports from abroad?",
            "answer": "The US dollar has stagnated relative to other major currencies, causing imports to rise as a percentage of domestic demand over the five years to 2021. However, the COVID-19 pandemic led to a decline in imports in 2020, before an expected resurgence in 2021."
        },

            "question": "Has your company located in proximity to its key downstream distributors to reduce shipping costs?",

            "question": "Have you been able to reduce wage costs by automating operations over the past five years?",
            "answer": "Companies have increasingly integrated automation into their operations, but the production process still requires skilled workers and technicians."

            "answer": "Larger companies in this industry will often try to acquire smaller competitors in order to benefit from economies of scale and increase their profitability. Some smaller operators were forced out of the industry in 2020 amid the economic shock of the COVID-19 pandemic, while larger companies that were able to take advantage of economies of scale were more resilient."

        {
            "question": "Has the decline in the TWI presented an opportunity for your company to expand into international markets amid disruption in domestic markets amid the pandemic? How much of your company's sales are derived from exports?",
            "answer": "As the trade-weighted index declines, the value of the dollar depreciates relative to other currencies, making exports more affordable to overseas customers while making imports less competitive with domestic products."
