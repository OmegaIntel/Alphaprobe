    "executive_summary": "The plumbing industry provides essential services for construction and renovation of nonresidential buildings like offices, hospitals, factories, retail stores, schools and entertainment centers. Following a pandemic decline, nonresidential construction has performed well due to surging online shopping driving warehouse construction, government spending on manufacturing/infrastructure, and rising data center construction from AI growth. However, rapidly increasing material and wage costs have driven up plumbers' rates, boosting revenue but pressuring profit. The residential construction market boomed during COVID-19 but has slowed since 2022 due to higher mortgage rates and less home improvement spending. An expected 2024 rate cut is positive for residential construction.",
