    "executive_summary": "The photography schools industry enjoyed solid revenue growth in the years leading up to the COVID-19 pandemic as spending on leisure activities and disposable income increased. However, the pandemic forced schools to contend with plummeting enrollment due to lockdowns and unemployment. As the pandemic subsided, attendance and revenue rebounded in 2021 but growth was slowed by widespread inflation. Industry revenue declined at an annualized 0.4% to $293.2 million in 2024, including a 0.4% drop in 2024 due to inflationary pressure. Revenue is largely driven by consumers' ability to afford photography classes and disposable income levels.",
