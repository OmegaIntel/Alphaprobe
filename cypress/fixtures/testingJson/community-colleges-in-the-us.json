    "executive_summary": "Community colleges have struggled to stop their downward trajectory over most of the five years to 2023. When the pandemic caused the national unemployment rate to spike in 2020, many students who would have otherwise enrolled in a community college deferred or delayed their admission. After the labor market's triumphant return in 2021 and 2022, growth in travel and other alternatives fueled a lack of interest in community colleges and higher education. Because of these challenges, industry-wide revenue has been falling at an annualized CAGR of 2.1% over the past five years and is expected to total $63.5 billion in 2023, when revenue will swell by an estimated 0.8%.",

These funds have helped make up for inconsistencies in municipal or state funds, which usually account for over half the industry's revenue but have been unreliable through the pandemic."

A shortage of nurses and other healthcare professionals has stimulated demand for relevant training in recent years, causing many community colleges to expand their course offerings to include the necessary certification programs. To remedy falling enrollment, institutions like New York's Hudson Valley Community College are partnering with other countries and local faith organizations in an effort to find success with students overseas. Community colleges are also expanding into younger markets by rolling out dual enrollment programs that allow high school students to get started earning college credits as early as 16."
