    "executive_summary": "Figures have been adjusted for inflation and are presented in 2024 currency. Manufacturers produce boilers and heat exchangers for heating liquids for the industrial, energy and commercial markets. During recent years, the industry has experienced significant levels of volatility. Manufacturers rely on various industries, resulting in a diversified revenue stream. The pandemic affected multiple downstream markets, particularly vehicle manufacturing. Similarly, rising inflation and interest rates have led to declines in the nonresidential construction sector. However, the war in Ukraine led to a global slowdown in oil production, boosting demand for the domestic oil and gas sector, a major market of the industry. Overall, boiler and heat exchanger manufacturing revenue has lagged at a CAGR of 2.9% to $8.4 billion over the five years to 2024, including a dip of 1.2% in 2024 alone.",

Strict tariffs on Chinese-produced boilers and heat exchangers caused the value of imports to fall, as imported products became comparatively higher priced than domestically produced goods, benefiting domestic manufacturers. The pandemic resulted in declines in industry profit, mainly caused by limitations on manufacturing, trade and new nonresidential construction."

The pandemic, input shortages, growing inflation and increasing interest rates discourage the purchase of new vehicles, lowering production and negatively affecting heat exchanger manufacturers. Industrial manufacturing slowed down due to pandemic-induced restrictions. Industrial manufacturing has not returned to pre-pandemic levels, putting downward pressure on industry revenue. Demand from food production facilities faced little change due to its inelastic nature. The segment has a lower impact on manufacturing activity and does not contribute heavily to revenue. However, it prevented further losses. Oil and gas production companies were directly impacted by increasing crude oil prices during the pandemic and then again with the war in Ukraine."

Lower production capacity combined with significant demand for home appliances and construction caused the price of steel to rise more than 90.0% in 2021. However, steel prices have fallen over the past five years, including plummeting over 40.0% in 2024. Falling steel prices constrain revenue as manufacturers can't price products as aggressively."

The price of Chinese goods became comparatively higher than domestically produced boilers and heat exchangers, boosting demand for domestic manufacturers. The United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) benefits domestic manufacturers as the trade agreement lowers exporting costs among the trading partners.
