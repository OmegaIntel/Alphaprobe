    "executive_summary": "Figures have been adjusted for inflation and are presented in 2024 currency.\n\nGarage door manufacturers are a vital component of both commercial and residential construction, providing an easily overlooked but essential element in any property that seeks to include attractive parking. This industry has endured drastic swings recently because of the pandemic. Lockdown orders for nonessential businesses kept workers at home, bringing production to a standstill while downstream demand buckled under the overpowering economic uncertainty. Commodity prices fell off as demand shriveled but quickly rose as a resurging economy demanded more than could be supplied, making managing input costs all the more complex and pressuring profit. Industry revenue has dropped at a CAGR of 0.3% to $5.4 billion through the end of 2024, including an expected hike of 2.2% in 2024 alone.\n\nAlthough commercial construction accounts for the majority of industry revenue, the health of both residential and nonresidential construction remains vital to this industry's performance. Commercial construction drastically fell during the height of the pandemic as businesses sought to cut costs and salvage whatever revenue they could. At the same time, residential construction received a substantial boost as consumer preferences shifted toward buying and renovating homes where everyone was stuck. According to the Remodeling Cost vs. Value report of 2023, garage door replacement remains one of the four home renovations that average a net-positive return once the resale value is factored in, aiding manufacturers. Residential construction has since fallen off while commercial construction has stabilized but is yet to return to growth, contributing to the slump in industry revenue even as the economy has healed.",

            "current_performance_point_description": "The US economy came to a screeching halt as COVID-19 swept the nation, as lockdown orders were put into place to mitigate the damage done by the virus. This brought business spending down rapidly, drastically reducing the value of nonresidential construction, and dragging down demand. Residential construction actually received a lift at this time, as consumer preferences shifted toward their living situations with so many other options cut off at the time. The balance between the drop in commercial construction and the rise in residential enabled this industry to stay afloat during the difficult times."

            "current_performance_point_description": "After pandemic-related disruptions faded, residential construction quickly fell back down. Consumers were able to return to their normal activities, drawing spending away from homes. The stabilization of commercial construction lured construction companies away from residential projects. This brought a substantial drop in revenue for garage door manufacturers, as commercial construction is yet to return to growth, throwing off the balancing act that carried them through the pandemic."

These high commodity prices pressured profit, as the variety of materials used to make garage doors all experienced this increase. Trade conditions remain poor, as import penetration has risen while exports have fallen to almost negligible values, driven by low labor costs abroad and an appreciating US dollar. Consolidation continues in this industry, as the larger manufacturers are able to use their power to secure the largest commercial contracts and push out competitors."
