    "executive_summary": "Credit bureaus and credit rating agents faced much volatility from downstream markets during the current period as COVID-19 and other economic disruptions hung over the US Economy. The diverse nature of downstream clients helped to shield the industry from more significant troubles. Throughout 2020, only a few credit reporters and CRA's downstream clients were greatly affected. Consumers and non-banking businesses took a big hit as unemployment skyrocketed and business closures spiked. Investment from banking institutions and federal and state governments stopped any other falling demand. Downstream demand was further spurred by increasing aggregate household debt as a result of low interest rates and greater financial innovation. High demand from banking institutions and growing household debt also raised profit for credit bureaus",

Higher levels of consumer debt are beneficial for companies' core services and heighten the need for more robust credit reporting agencies that can handle a larger quantity of customers. During the current period, consumers had unprecedented access and availability to credit because of low interest rates and financial innovation, leading to boosted demand for consumer credit rating services and benefiting the industry."

            "current_performance_point_title": "Despite the disruptions to the US economy during COVID-19, aggregate household debt still rose in 2020 as the low cost of borrowing spurred home buying.

            "current_performance_point_description": "As the US faced a looming recession brought about by COVID-19 disruptions, downstream demand fell across several markets, as exemplified by a sharp plunge in the Consumer Confidence Index in 2020. Early disruptions related to the pandemic caused a major drop in stock prices since investors were very worried about the future. Expansive fiscal and monetary policy and the development of an early vaccine caused investors' confidence to recover a few months later, leading to a massive jump in most stock indices. Banking institutions benefited from the historically strong stock market. Higher equity prices gave finance companies more funds to lend out money. To pursue these investments carefully, they increased their uptake in rating agencies' services, which boosted revenue for the industry. A bolstered government spending agenda gave the industry sustained demand during COVID-19. State, local and the national government financed several large projects and assistance programs. This raised debt levels, keeping the need for debt collectors high as well."

            "future_outlook_point_description": "As a result of the high cost of borrowing, homebuying plunged since it became more expensive to purchase a new or existing residence. This hindered aggregate household debt and reduced downstream demand for credit bureaus. Rising interest rates also reduced consumer spending and confidence, heightening recessionary fears. These fears caused big declines in stock prices, inhibiting financial institutions' performance and severely curtailing downstream demand from these companies. As a result of these factors, revenue plunged in 2022. As inflation fell and the economy experienced significant economic growth, investors became much more confident and stock prices rose. These developments helped revenue expand in 2023 and 2024."

Lenders will respond by purchasing rating agencies' and credit bureaus' reports on the creditworthiness of these companies, spurring revenue growth.",
            "future_outlook_point_description": "While the number of businesses will surge during the outlook period, aggregate household debt will decline. This will be caused by consumers borrowing less money because of fears over uncertain economic events (e.g., recessions), making it more difficult for households to meet their obligations. Lower household debt will hinder the need for credit reports and rating agencies' services, negatively impacting revenue growth."

The proliferation of mobile applications and digital data processing among credit rating agencies helped accelerate information breakdown and enabled players to elevate their ability to service customers. Another unique development that will enhance credit bureaus and rating agencies' credibility is the move toward cloud data services, which enable more secure and robust data processing of clients' core information. During the outlook period, agencies will continue to adopt these applications, making them more attractive among potential clients and raising their credibility."

This is unlikely to continue through 2029 and is poised to expand at a subdued rate through the end of the outlook period, as economic conditions are poised to stabilize. The industry benefitted from massive demand from banks, businesses, consumers and the government after COVID-19, causing stock prices to soar. This set of circumstances is unlikely to happen again, especially in the next five years. Slower growth in the S&P 500 will hinder the amount of excess cash corporations have to lend. This will reduce downstream demand for rating agencies' services from financial institutions, contributing to weakened revenue growth during the outlook period."
