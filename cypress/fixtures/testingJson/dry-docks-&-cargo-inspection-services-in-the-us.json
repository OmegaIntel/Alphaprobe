    "executive_summary": "The industry provides maintenance, cargo inspection and other commercial and government watercraft support services. Increased trade activity in recent years has increased demand for these services, fueled by rising consumption and industrial production. As more cargo ships facilitate trade, demand for ship repair and other maintenance services rises. Simultaneously, declines in federal defense spending and outdated infrastructure in many US ports have constrained revenue and profitability during the current period. The COVID-19 pandemic significantly hampered trade activity and consumer spending, temporarily mitigating revenue. Revenue for dry docks and cargo inspection services is expected to climb at a CAGR of 6.0% to $2.9 billion through the end of 2024, including growth of 1.4% in 2024.",
