    "executive_summary": "Figures have been adjusted for inflation and are presented in 2024 currency.\n\nMarket research demand has risen consistently over the past five years, benefiting business information resellers, which are part of that larger sector. Businesses that invest in product development typically also invest in outside information and analysis. Operators generate revenue by aggregating data, articles and research reports and offering the content to clients, typically on a subscription basis. As research and development continues to remain a rapidly growing sector of the overall economy, information and access to information has become a hot commodity across the service economy, which bolstered core revenue channels for operators. Over the past five years, revenue has been growing at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 3.7% and is expected to reach $6.9 billion in 2023. This includes an estimated 7.1% boost in 2023 alone.",
