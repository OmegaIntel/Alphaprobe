Over the five years to 2022, changing consumer preferences, rising import dominance and the pressure to move offshore have adversely affected revenue for the industry. Additionally, the COVID-19 (coronavirus) pandemic caused demand for industry products to plummet as working-from-home became commonplace and the need for professional attire was removed, and industry revenue dropped 20.0% in 2020 alone. Overall, over the five years to 2022, industry revenue is expected to fall at an annualized rate of 6.2% to $763.9 million, despite a rise of 0.7% in 2022.",

Fashion trends have changed, since bare legs and casual attire have become more acceptable in professional environments.

In line with revenue decline, wages have fallen over the past five years at an annualized rate of 5.3% to $223.0 million.
