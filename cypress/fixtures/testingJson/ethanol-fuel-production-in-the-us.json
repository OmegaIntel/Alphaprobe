    "executive_summary": "The Ethanol Fuel Production industry consists of companies that concentrate on producing nonpotable ethanol, or ethyl alcohol, for use as motor fuel. Products are primarily used as a biofuel additive for gasoline. According to the United States Department of Energy, more than 98.0% of gas in the United States contains some ethanol. Ethanol fuel is a domestically produced alternative to traditional fuel, generally made from corn. The dry-milling process, which composes most ethanol plants in the US, involves converting corn to flour and fermenting it to form ethanol. This makes operations highly sensitive to commodity prices, such as the world price of crude oil and corn.",

Many governments have implemented policies and regulations favoring biofuels to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. This regulatory support has encouraged investors to pour more resources into ethanol production. With the growing emphasis on sustainability, consumers are also becoming more inclined towards ethanol. Expanding infrastructure and technological advancements have bolstered production capabilities."

Similarly, over 90.0% of ethanol produced in the US is produced using starch from corn grain, which makes the industry highly sensitive to the price of corn. When commodity prices are higher, the price of ethanol increases, which expands industry revenue."
