    "executive_summary": "Rising utility costs have put considerable pressure on the laundromat industry. However, following the Federal Reserve's decision to aggressively raise interest rates multiple times in 2022-2023, a tighter policy has affected budgets and decreased disposable income, favoring the industry. So, industry-wide revenue has increased at a CAGR of 0.5% over the past five years, including an estimated 1.5% decrease in 2023 and is expected to total $6.6 billion. In the same year, profit is projected to increase to 22.2%.",

            "current_performance_point_description": "During recessionary periods and housing market volatility, laundromat usage typically increases as more people cannot afford to purchase or repair laundry machines and opt for rental housing. Seasonality also plays a role in laundromat demand, with a significant share of revenue generated from college students during the year's first, second and fourth quarters. As rental vacancy rates drop, more renters occupy properties. Many rental properties lack personal laundry appliances, leading to increased need for laundromat services among these renters."

Hence, proximity to consumers becomes critical. Laundromats can reduce competition by taking advantage of high consumer volume in urban areas like New York City, Washington, Philadelphia and Pittsburgh."

For instance, HamperApp is a real-time laundry service application that links busy individuals with nearby laundry professionals who can cater to their laundry needs. Utilizing this application in the industry enhances the existing digital presence and precisely targets potential customers."

As per capita disposable income rises, more Americans can afford drop-off and pick-up laundry and dry-cleaning services, undermining industry revenue.

            "question": "Are your sales reliant on the overall health of the US economy (i.e. consumer spending and per capita disposable income)? How has your business been impacted by the changes in consumer sentiment amid the coronavirus pandemic?",
            "answer": "The industry is inversely related to growth in the economy, typically increasing in times of lower disposable income and high unemployment levels and decreasing in times of economic prosperity and increased spending. As a result, changes in consumer spending patterns that have come since the outbreak of the coronavirus pandemic may benefit some industry players."
        },

            "question": "How has your business been impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic?",
            "answer": "The vast majority of industry establishments were deemed essential during the nationwide stay-at-home in 2020 to slow the spread of COVID-19. Despite this, laundromats were still negatively impacted by consumers opting to spend more time at home than usual."

            "answer": "A key success factor for laundromats is the ability to take advantage of location benefits. Since most laundromats do not differ drastically, success is dependent on proximity to consumers. There has been a spike in demand for residential housing in less densely populated areas since the pandemic began. This may have had a negative impact on some industry operators located in typically densely populated urban areas."
        },
        {
            "question": "Does your company offer ancillary services to diversify revenue streams?",

            "question": "How do your company's profit margins compare to your main competitors'? How has profitability been impacted by the ongoing coronavirus pandemic?",
            "answer": "Average profit margins decreased in 2020 due to intense internal competition and unfavorable operating conditions due to COVID-19. Profit is expected to remain lower even after the impacts of the pandemic have faded due to heavy competition."
        },
        {
            "question": "How frequently does your company have to replace its equipment? How do you typically finance larger purchases?",
            "answer": "The average lifespan of a washer is between 10 and 14 years and a dryer's average lifespan is between 10 and 13 years. Laundromats must ensure that their machines are working and efficient in order to retain customers, as well as attract new consumers."

        },
        {
            "question": "Are your facilities able to be adapted to comply with local social-distancing guidelines? Do guidelines prevent your business from operating at full capacity?",
            "answer": "Many local governments have implemented new guidelines aimed at helping business operators continue operating in a safe fashion. These guidelines may include measures such as limiting the number of patrons allowed in a location at a given time, which could have an adverse effect on an operator's revenue."

        {
            "question": "How is your business affected during periods of lower disposable income? How has your business been impacted amid lower consumer confidence caused by the economic impacts of the COVID-19 (coronavirus) pandemic?",
            "answer": "As per capita disposable income increases, more-expensive laundry alternatives become available to consumers. With growing incomes, consumers can afford to purchase laundry machines and pay for drop-off laundry services, reducing demand for laundromats. Due to higher unemployment and lower consumer confidence, many consumers may opt to continue using industry services rather than purchase an in-home washer and dryer in the near future."

        {
            "question": "How closely do you monitor the price of electric power? Do you offer energy-efficient products? How do you work to minimize utility costs for your business?",
            "answer": "A considerable amount of energy is required for laundromat operations. Given the lack of viable substitutes among the industry's low-income consumers, industry operators can, in most cases, pass along a portion of the utility price increase, positively impacting revenue."

        {
            "question": "How heavily do you rely on revenue from universities and colleges? How has your business been impacted since many universities have transitioned to remote learning amid the coronavirus pandemic?",
            "answer": "Colleges and universities account for a prominent share of demand for industry services. This is because the industry provides colleges and universities with coin- or card-operated washers and dryers. Therefore, when enrollment increases, more students purchase laundry services. Since the initial outbreak of the coronavirus pandemic in early 2020, many universities have offered remote instruction, lowering the amount of students on and near campuses, posing a threat to operators that are dependent on college students."
