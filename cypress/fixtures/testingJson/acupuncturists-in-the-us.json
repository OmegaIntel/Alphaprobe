Although both public and private insurers provide coverage for acupuncture under various circumstances, the lack of comprehensive clinical evidence limits the extent of this coverage. Despite disruptions caused by the pandemic, acupuncture services were considered essential, resulting in continued industry growth and increasing profit. Key growth drivers include a growing older adult population experiencing more chronic pain, expanding Medicare coverage and gains in per capita disposable income that would cover out-of-pocket costs. The need for definitive research on acupuncture's efficacy persists, yet",
