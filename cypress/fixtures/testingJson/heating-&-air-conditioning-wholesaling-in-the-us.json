During the pandemic, the residential market boomed thanks to low interest rates, which drove housing starts and home improvement projects. Wholesalers thrived because of this, with substantial demand for HVAC systems. However, interest rate hikes have since cooled this surge, leading to a drop in single-family home construction. In contrast, the apartment building market has remained resilient, buoyed by high homeownership costs pushing more people towards rentals. Wholesalers have also benefited from the commercial market's recovery, particularly renovations of existing properties and the expansion of warehousing driven by e-commerce.",
