    "executive_summary": "The Auto Glass Repair and Replacement Franchises industry has experienced volatile conditions over the five years to 2022. Broken or damaged windows in cars and trucks often must be repaired fairly quickly because the damaged glass may interfere with the safety of the driver and the vehicle. Additionally, drivers can be ticketed for windshield cracks in many states. While the costs of these repairs are often covered by auto insurance providers, which helps shield the industry from sudden declines in its customers' disposable income levels, the industry still tends to benefit from a stronger economy as individuals are less inclined to put off repairs when they feel confident in the economy. Thus, industry revenue growth decelerated in 2020 due to the adverse economic effects of the COVID-19 (coronavirus) pandemic, as well as the decline in total vehicle miles driven due to travel restrictions and work-from-home designations. Comparatively, auto glass repairs cannot be deterred as readily as other discretionary auto services, preventing a decline. In all, industry revenue is expected to increase an annualized 3.9% to $224.4 million over the five years to 2022, including 3.3% growth in 2022.",

            "current_performance_point_description": "During the five-year period, competition within the industry has intensified. Franchisees offer price discounting to attract customers away from other establishments, often at the expense of average industry profit. While nonfranchise glass repair shops have to invest heavily in promoting their services, franchises benefit from co-op advertising on national and regional media for a comparatively smaller cost. However, long-term shifts to more-diversified product offerings and independent branding continued during the period. As a result, industry profit, measured as earnings before interest and taxes, has declined to 8.0% in 2022 from 14.4% in 2017."

            "current_performance_point_description": "Over the five years to 2027, industry revenue is expected to increase an annualized 1.3% to $239.4 million. Growth early in the period can be contributed to economic improvements following the pandemic. Additionally, as more cars are sold as consumer confidence rises, more consumers will be at risk of costlier collisions, helping industry operators. Notably, the industry will likely be characterized by advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) in the outlook period. Although ADAS prevent vehicle collisions, reducing demand for the industry, they also present an opportunity for costlier repair services to industry operators."

            "future_outlook_point_description": "Demand for auto glass repair services can be negatively affected by unexpected declines in automobile accidents. With the US economy anticipated to improve over the five years to 2027, growth in car sales will likely result in an increase of the number of new cars with advanced safety features on the road. According to the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, two major causes of collisions are driver distraction and fatigue. While these causes are inevitable, new car features, such as crash-avoidance technologies, introduce alert systems and automatic breaking to help drivers remain alert and avoid crashes. These features may keep more windshields intact than industry operators would like."

            "future_outlook_point_title": "STRUCTURE AND DEVELOPMENTS",
            "future_outlook_point_description": "In previous years, the focus of automotive safety technology was on crash control (e.g., seat belts, airbags and sturdier windshields). This focus is anticipated to be honed in over the next five years, hurting industry operators. A renewed emphasis is expected to be placed on value-added safety features, such as better lighting systems for night driving, strategic sensor placement to detect cars within side-view blind spots and sensors and cameras embedded within the vehicle aimed at preventing car damage when parking and driving. Additionally, ADAS features and sensors are expected to be integrated into more cars in the outlook period. Cars manufactured with ADAS feature cameras and sensors throughout the vehicle on the front and back windshields and side-view mirrors. While the majority of ADAS repairs are currently made at dealerships, it is likely auto glass repair shops will make these repairs moving forward. While this presents an opportunity for the industry in the form of higher-margin, costlier repairs, it also poses a risk, as a greater number of cars with ADAS will reduce the total number of cars requiring repairs overall. Nonetheless, over the next five years, the total number of motor vehicle registrations is forecast to increase at an annualized rate of 1.6% to 308.5 million vehicles."
