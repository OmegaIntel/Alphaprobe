Consumers and businesses are less inclined to invest in this industry in uncertain economic conditions. This instability primarily stems from an unpredictable economic environment where interest rates have consistently increased. So, industry-wide revenue has decreased at an estimated CAGR of 6.7% over the past five years, including an approximate 1.0% hike in the current year, and it is expected to total $538.9 million in 2024. In the same year, profit is projected to drop to 11.7%.",

Many service providers have attempted to reduce the size of their labor force to maintain profitability and minimize costs.

Consequently, the level of industry employment has declined over the past five years."
