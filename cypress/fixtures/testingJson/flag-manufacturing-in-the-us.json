Similar to most textile manufacturing industries in the United States, the industry experiences intense competition from lower-priced imports. Goods manufactured domestically tend to command higher prices, largely due to the relatively high labor costs domestic producers pay compared with their international counterparts. Consequently, demand for industry products has declined as consumers have increasingly elected to purchase inexpensive, foreign-produced flags over the past five years.",
