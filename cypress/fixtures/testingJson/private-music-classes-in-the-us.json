    "executive_summary": "The private music instruction industry is estimated to have steadily grown over the past five years. The COVID-19 pandemic contributed to a large drop in music class attendance, though lessons via video call software helped support the industry. Strong disposable income growth supported industry recovery as demand for learning instruments bounced back. More recently, the popularity of music instruction has supported further revenue growth, though weaker economic conditions are likely to cause growth to slow. Over the past five years, revenue is estimated to rise at a CAGR of 1.2% to $725.0 million, with growth of 1.1% forecast for 2024.",
