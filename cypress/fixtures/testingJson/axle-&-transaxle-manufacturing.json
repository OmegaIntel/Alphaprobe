    "executive_summary": "The Axle and Transaxle Manufacturing industry has experienced declines over the five years to 2022 amid COVID-19 (coronavirus) volatility. Industry operators manufacture axles, which is the central shaft used to connect two parallel wheels in a vehicle. They also manufacture transaxles, which combine the function of the axle, the gear changing components of a transmission and the power splitting ability of the auto differential. Industry revenue is largely tied to the production of vehicles. New car sales declined in 2020 amid the coronavirus pandemic, declining 14.7% in 2020. This decline contributed to the overall decrease in industry revenue, which is expected to decline at an annualized rate of 1.0% to $9.9 billion over the five years to 2022. However, as the economy began to recover in 2021 and continues to do so, industry revenue is expected to increase. Specifically, revenue for the industry is anticipated to grow 1.9% in 2022 alone.",
