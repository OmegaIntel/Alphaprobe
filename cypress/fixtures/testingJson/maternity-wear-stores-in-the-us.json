Operators in this industry specialize in clothing targeted to pregnant women. The industry does not include maternity wear from department stores or other large-scale retailers. One of the primary challenges experienced by the industry has been the declining number of births over the past five years, resulting in softer demand for maternity apparel.",

The combination of social distancing regulations and overall decreased consumer spending caused industry revenue to plummet in 2020."

During the past decade, many women have chosen to delay childbirth to instead focus on their careers. Older first-time mothers typically have higher incomes and subsequently are willing to purchase more premium-level clothing than younger mothers that have children earlier in their lives. Additionally, the number of households earning more than $100,000 has increased over the past five years, further bolstering the upscale market. The rise of upscale operators has also benefitted profit, which has remained strong over the past five years."
