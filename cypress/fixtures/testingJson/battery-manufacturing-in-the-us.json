However, demand for lithium-ion batteries for electric vehicles has been a driving force, leading to new entrants specializing in EV battery manufacturing. Revenue is estimated to have grown at a CAGR of 0.6% to $11.9 billion through 2024, with a 1.1% boost in 2024 alone. Macroeconomic factors like consumer spending, trade deficits, and the strength of the US dollar have impacted revenue growth. Going forward, expanding EV demand, stabilizing inflation, and a weaker US dollar are expected to boost revenue growth.",
