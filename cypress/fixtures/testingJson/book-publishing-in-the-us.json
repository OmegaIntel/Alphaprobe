As industry enterprises resumed production in 2021 following the adverse influence of the pandemic, sales have rebounded, temporarily buoying the industry. However, the industry remains pressured, with pent-up demand for books having largely been satisfied as of 2021, while continued rising prices of paper, a major input, have made production costs for books more expensive, resulting in higher prices hurting industry demand. Industry revenue is expected to contract at a CAGR of 0.6% to $44.2 billion through the end of 2024, including an estimated 0.2% slide in 2024 alone, as profit shrinks to 5.7% of revenue.",

Paper prices significantly affect the book publishing market. In 2020, many industries suspended or limited operations, reducing demand for paper. As the economy reopened in 2021, paper demand increased, which helped raise paper prices again, increasing purchasing costs. High paper prices have cut"

Publishers returning to a normalized production schedule could produce physical books at an appropriate rate to satisfy pent-up demand. As publishers ramped up production again in 2021, the pent-up demand for physical books was largely satisfied. With demand for books normalizing back to pre-pandemic levels, publishers have struggled to match the growing onset of popular self-publishing services, such as Wattpad, enabling users to post their stories without relying on major publishers."

Smaller and mid-sized publishers have struggled amid stagnant demand and heightened competition. Unlike larger publishers, smaller publishers do not have the capital to offer authors exclusive deals. As this industry has endured challenges, enterprises have started cutting back on wage expenses to maintain profitability. E-books continued to gain popularity, with many readers opting for digital formats over traditional print books."

As a result, e-book sales have surged and contributed to declining demand from bookstores. Self-publishing platforms such as Amazon Kindle Direct Publishing (KDP) provide authors with more opportunities to publish their work independently, bypassing traditional publishing houses. The industry has been susceptible to price erosion, with e-reader sales cannibalizing print sales and reducing the industry's ability to invest in advances for unproven concepts by new authors."

Users have been increasingly relying on websites, such as Wikipedia, which grant users access to thousands of pages covering various subjects rather than acquiring books, such as encyclopedias.
