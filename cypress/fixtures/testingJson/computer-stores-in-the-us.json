    "executive_summary": "The computer stores industry has experienced moderate volatility in recent years. Significant competition from consumer electronic stores and upstream producers has put downward pressure on revenue growth. However, the growing reliance of consumers on computers for personal use, work, and school has led to significant revenue gains. This trend was enhanced in 2020 due to the pandemic, which pushed many workers and students to operate remotely, driving computer sales. Similarly, growing disposable income during this time and retailers passing down cost increases to consumers contributed to these gains.",

            "current_performance_point_description": "Although computer stores have been falling in popularity because of the growth in demand for major retailers, such as Best Buy, they are still a common outlet for consumers to buy computers. During the 2020 pandemic, the large need for computers, particularly as remote working and learning became the norm, contributed to jumping sales. The rising price of computers also supported revenue growth. Supply chain disruptions and higher semiconductor prices pushed stores to pass down cost increases to buyers, boosting revenue. Growing disposable income has also supported computer sales as consumers buy more electronics and other discretionary products when economic conditions are favorable."

Manufacturers and software developers, in particular, can offer lower prices to consumers, posing a significant threat. Retailers such as Best Buy and Walmart leverage their brands and contracts with manufacturers to sell computers and peripheral equipment at competitive prices, agreements that smaller stores are often unable to reach. Online shopping platforms allow consumers to compare products and make informed decisions without needing to speak with store associates, eliminating the need to visit a specialized computer retail establishment."

            "current_performance_point_description": "While external competitors have largely met most demand, retailers have benefited from adding services like repairs and having highly trained employees to support consumers while shopping. Some stores have diversified their product offerings to include other consumer electronics products. Still, this has drawn revenue away from the industry because these retailers are often transitioning to operate in the consumer electronics stores space. Rising consumer spending and a household computer ownership boost have supported computer stores."

New technologies will continue to be developed over the coming years, driving revenue growth.

Since by selling directly to consumers, upstream producers can become more profitable and competitive, direct-to-consumer sales will continue growing over the coming years, threatening demand for computer stores. These heightened levels of external competition will prevent retailers from becoming significantly more profitable. However, the growing demand for new computers and other electronics will enable the industry to continue growing."
