In addition, a source of external competition for cold cups is plastic disposable cups. Since plastic disposable cups cannot be used for hot cups, as the plastic will melt into the cup due to the hot liquid, this is not a source of competition for this product segment. However, reusable cups are a source of competition for hot cups and this trend is expected to increase over the outlook period as consumers continually become more environmentally conscious."
