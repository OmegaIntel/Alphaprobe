During the early stages of the pandemic, manufacturers experienced a boom in sales, as low interest rates and high disposable income supported the residential market through gains in housing starts and existing home sales. Consumers often purchase new pieces to furnish their homes after moving. However, high inflation and elevated interest rates caused the residential sector to slow down, reversing the 2021 gains. These factors caused revenue to fall at an estimated CAGR of 4.8% to $23.5 billion over the past five years, including a 4.7% lag in 2023 alone.",
