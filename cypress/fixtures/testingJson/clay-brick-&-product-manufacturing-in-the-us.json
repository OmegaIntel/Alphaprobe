    "executive_summary": "Figures have been adjusted for inflation and are presented in 2024 currency. Clay brick and product manufacturers produce clay bricks, ceramic tiles and refractory products principally used by the construction and manufacturing sectors. Over the past five years, clay producers have faced a major challenge from the pandemic, when declining consumer spending has reduced nonresidential construction and manufacturing output. Demand from residential markets was still strong, as low interest rates and government subsidization enabled lots of homebuying. As economic indicators improved during the post-pandemic recovery, revenue for the industry rose in tandem. However, rising interest rates in recent years have been causing spending on residential and nonresidential construction to plunge, reducing demand from two major downstream markets and causing revenue to tank. Recent trade wars have also disrupted the industry, as confrontation with China has reduced the import and export of clay products. Overall, revenue for clay brick and product manufacturers has lagged at a CAGR of 1.6% to $6.4 billion over the past five years, including a decline of 1.0% in 2024 alone. Clay and brick product manufacturers are expected to do much better during the outlook period but will still face a host of challenges. The US dollar is anticipated to depreciate, which will cause exports to surge, pushing revenue up. Economic growth is forecast to be steady, limiting declines in steel manufacturing demand and supporting spending on refractory products and nonresidential construction. In addition, these positive developments will contribute to residential construction growth. However, revenue for clay makers is projected to be threatened by growing competition from substitutes. Overall, clay brick and product manufacturing revenue is forecast to increase at a CAGR of 1.2% to $6.8 billion over the five years to 2029.",

The effects of the trade war with China and poor international relations with other trading partners resulted in a decline in imports and exports in 2019, resulting in falling revenue during the same year."

In addition, limited household spending resulted in plunging revenue for manufacturers. Despite the malaise that the pandemic caused, clay brick and product manufacturers benefited from a jump in housing starts, as low interest rates and government support enabled consumers to buy new homes."

Higher rates are increasing the cost of borrowing, severely inhibiting construction on residential and commercial projects. Since construction is the largest source of downstream demand for clay brick and product manufacturers, the poor performance of the construction sector has caused revenue for the industry to fall every year in the latter part of the current period, eliminating the gains displayed during the post-pandemic recovery."

Strong economic growth will boost business sentiment and growth in nonresidential construction will contribute to limiting declines in steel manufacturing. Clay brick and product manufacturers get lots of business from commercial projects, so more nonresidential construction is expected to benefit the industry. Limited declines in demand for steel manufacturing will help contribute to the need for refractories, further boosting revenue for the industry."

When the value of the US dollar is lower, consumers abroad view domestic goods as less expensive, so spending on industry products will surge.

In addition, spending on clay bricks and products from the residential market will push up. This will result in revenue growth, in line with rising exports."

More homeowners are expected to replace bricks with wood in their homes and use more glass instead of ceramic tiles for aesthetic designs. Corporations are anticipated to start preferring carpeting, hardwood and vinyl instead of ceramic tiles when designing their office space. Competition from these substitutes is expected to limit demand for clay bricks and products in residential and nonresidential construction."
