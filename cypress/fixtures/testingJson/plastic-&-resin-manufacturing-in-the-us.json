Although prices moderated in 2023, prices are expected to trend flat to upward through 2024, aligning with rising producer price indices and global energy price projections. Demand for plastic and resin is expected to remain soft in 2024 due to sluggish manufacturing activity and economic softness. The volatility in sales stemming from significant price swings and supply chain disruptions shows ongoing challenges for the industry, contributing to an estimated 0.9% CAGR revenue decline over the past five years, reaching $103.9 billion by 2024.",
