    "executive_summary": "The Plumbing Service Franchises industry includes franchised outlets that provide services such as installing and maintaining plumbing fixtures, fittings and equipment. The industry's performance is directly linked to building construction markets and consumer spending levels. The industry also benefits from stable demand from homes and businesses that need repair and maintenance of water delivery systems. Maintenance work accounts for a sizable share of demand and is a stable source of revenue when construction markets fluctuate. Consequently, increases in residential construction activity and private spending on home improvements have benefited industry operators. In fact, the substantial reduction of interest rates amid the COVID-19 (coronavirus) pandemic has been the driving force behind growth in the residential construction sector. However, despite favorable interest rates, nonresidential construction projects were halted and postponed due to government mandated establishment closures and restrictions. Still, increased demand throughout the majority of the five years to 2021 has benefited plumbing franchises.",

Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, unemployment remained relatively lower than its historical norm, which boosted per capita disposable income. As per capita disposable income increased, consumers felt relatively more comfortable in their financial situations, which led to an increase in consumer spending."

Establishments were forced to close down to curtail the spread of the virus, resulting in historical levels of unemployment. As a result, activity within the nonresidential building market significantly reduced, as businesses were not able to properly function and thus demand from the commercial sector contracted."
