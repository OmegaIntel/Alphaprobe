As construction levels rise, construction machinery manufacturers (33312) will experience an uptick in demand for their products, which will, in turn, lead to higher levels of demand for diesel engines and parts. Additionally, demand for mining, oil and gas machinery manufacturers (33313) is expected to recover over the next five years, as the price of crude oil is forecast to experience less price volatility. Although the price of crude oil is declining, oil machinery manufacturers increase their production as demand from their downstream markets grows.",
