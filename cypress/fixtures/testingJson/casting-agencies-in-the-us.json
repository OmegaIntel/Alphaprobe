Casting directors' expertise lies in their ability to spot strong candidates that also match the specific requests of the project's creators, though it's ultimately the producer of the project that decides which actor will be cast. The actor, the casting director and the actor's agent receive a commission based on the pay schedule of the selected actor.",

When the economy struggles, consumer disposable incomes will likely be very limited and shift away from entertainment purchases; this has been felt recently amid heightened inflation, which has curtailed consumers' discretionary spending."

Aspiring producers and talented videographers often create online content which draws in high traffic that rivals the quality and viewership of TV and movies. Since these videos are typically created independently and viewed for free, the need for the industry's talent-scouting services are far below that of major production companies.

During the strike, advertisers and production companies faced challenges because union members were not available to work on union-sanctioned projects. Last time SAG-AFTRA went on strike, it lasted for six months and revenue declined by 7.3%. In 2001, growth was limited at 0.1%, and it was increasing at a normal rate by 2002.

The swelling competition of free online broadcast platforms for traditional media will likely keep looming over the industry. The continued growth in streaming series and advertising suggests the continued necessity of casting agencies, particularly for extras, stand-ins and body doubles.

The most acclaimed shows are expansively premiering exclusively on online platforms like Hulu, Amazon and Netflix.

        "Casting agencies rely heavily on steady output from the Movie and Video Production and Television Production industries. Film and TV producers hire casting agencies to find talent, and these agencies generate revenue through commission fees on successful castings.",

Some population-dense areas have a wider pool of potential actors and actresses, making it a more favorable terrain for smaller casting agencies looking to reach a wide client base. New York City and Los Angeles are major markets for talent scouting. In particular, New York is home to many high-profile Broadway theater productions, commercial studios and TV studios, making it a lucrative market for the overall entertainment sector.",
