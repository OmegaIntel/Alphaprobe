        },
        {
            "question": "Does your company specialize in one corner of the market or produce a diversified range of products?",
            "answer": "The average company in the industry has shifted manufacturing operations to focus on high-end auto parts. Some companies focus on heating, ventilation and air-conditioning (HVAC) systems, exhaust systems, airbags, radiators and more. Some specialize, while others produce a variety of parts."

        {
            "question": "Has your company been exposed to volatile input prices over the past few years?",
            "answer": "Recent rises in key metals like aluminum and steel have hurt the profitability of the average company in the past few years. Recently imposed tariffs on these metals have put more upward pressure on their prices."

        },
        {
            "question": "How is your company leveraging new technology in its operations?",
            "answer": "While autonomous cars are decades away, the components that make the technology possible are being integrated into current vehicles. Increasing connectivity in modern cars has provided an outlet for manufacturers to produce increasingly complex pieces that interact with other parts of the car."
        },
        {
            "question": "Have you been able to reduce wage costs by automating operations during the current period?",
            "answer": "Labor costs in this industry are slightly inflated due to the prevalence of unionization in the industry workforce. Still, companies have exhibited leaner and more automated manufacturing styles, which have been further supported by new labor contracts that have somewhat limited wages."

        },
        {
            "question": "How has your company dealt with elevated energy prices in recent months?",
            "answer": "Companies in this industry rely heavily on downstream demand from car purchases and usage. When energy prices are high, it will reduce revenue for most auto parts manufacturers."
        },
        {
            "question": "What percentage of your company's customers renew their contracts?",
            "answer": "Most major companies have long-term, specialized relationships with major US automakers. Companies tend to tailor auto parts for the automaker they supply. This often ensures consistent contract renewal."

        },
        {
            "question": "Do you operate near optimum capacity? If not, what changes can you make to do so? How has your current level of capacity utilization affected profit margins?",
            "answer": "Successful companies must operate near optimum capacity to remain profitable. Operators also need to continually align production capacity to the production level of automakers."
        },
        {
            "question": "How often do you monitor exchange rates to prepare for possible increases or decreases in demand? How can you take advantage when the trade-weighted index decreases?",
            "answer": "When the US dollar is relatively weak, domestically produced auto parts become more affordable than foreign-made auto parts. The effects of exchange rates are often mitigated by long-term supply contracts between automakers and large auto parts manufacturers. The US dollar will weaken against foreign currencies in the coming years, resulting in a favorable environment for manufacturers that rely on exports to fuel revenue."
        },
        {
            "question": "Do you monitor the oil and natural gas price index?",
            "answer": "As the price of oil declines, so does the price of gasoline, and consumers are more willing to purchase large SUVs and light trucks. As gas prices decline, consumers tend to feel relatively better off financially."
        },
        {
            "question": "How does demand for your products fluctuate when motor vehicle production increases or decreases? How can you adapt when new car sales decline?",
            "answer": "The majority of auto parts are manufactured to be used in cars and light trucks, so higher car sales will increase the need for automotive parts. New car sales typically grow and contract with the economy as a whole."
