Likewise, exploration into the functions of each human gene has facilitated the commercial shift away from diagnostics and toward the development of a new generation of therapeutics. Since new drugs, therapies, surgical procedures and medical devices require clinical trials and regulatory approval before they are brought to market, technological innovation in downstream industries has increased demand for the industry's clinical trial support services."
