Overall economic conditions will influence the need for consulting services. When corporate profit rises, businesses often seek new ways to invest excess cash and expand or improve operations. When corporate profit declines, businesses often use consulting services when restructuring to improve profitability or readjust sales strategies to stem losses. Consequently, countercyclical demand can help insulate consultants from experiencing significant aggregate revenue contractions during recessions."
