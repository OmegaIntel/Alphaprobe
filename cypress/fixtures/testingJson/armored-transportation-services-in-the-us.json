Over the past five years, the industry has benefited from growth following the greater economy. In particular, consumer spending has climbed, increasing the number of cash transactions. Even so, the industry has faced mounting pressure, particularly from the growing prevalence of noncash payment methods and the increasing negotiating power of banks, the industry's largest client base. Through 2023, the industry will expand at an expected CAGR of 2.5% to $4.4 billion, including a 1.7% hike in 2023 as the economy continues to recover from the pandemic, spurring spending and banking activity.",

The top providers, though, have hesitated to work with marijuana shops; this market represents a growing source of demand as many states legalize the drug for medicinal and recreational use. Even so, the federal government maintains its prohibition, discouraging banks from handling this industry's finances, increasing the need for cash-handling operations. The top companies have avoided this market's inherent volatility, granting small companies opportunities to offer CIT and even marijuana transportation services."

            "current_performance_point_description": "Companies have contended with the rising use of noncash payment methods. The proliferation of online connectivity and mobile devices has led to skyrocketing e-commerce activity, particularly following the pandemic. As more people use electronic and contactless payment options, like credit cards, PayPal or Zelle, key clients will have less cash on hand and less need for cash-in-transit services. Similarly, fewer consumers will need ATMs as more businesses accept noncash payments, cutting into the industry's ATM service segment. Many local bank branches have also closed as more people choose mobile banking, significantly limiting the industry's client pool. Even so, the economy's recovery and fiscal spending have supported consumer spending, increasing the amount of cash transactions. This trend has boosted demand for the industry."

These services often involve verifying, reconciling, processing and storing customer cash. By providing these services, providers have managed to offset the weakening performance in the CIT and ATM service segments. Also, cash handling and management are less expensive to provide than CIT because service providers don't need to invest in armored vehicles, offering services from fixed locations."

Many businesses and consumers also prefer the convenience of noncash transactions. For example, McKinsey reports that more than two-thirds of American consumers have active digital wallets, and 30.0% of consumers expect to use multiple digital wallets and payment apps. According to PwC, the expected volume of cashless transactions in the United States will nearly double by the decade's end. Electronic wallet adoption will skyrocket. This increase in digital payments will challenge the industry, greatly reducing the need for cash transportation, despite the economy's recovery. Many larger companies will instead shift to ancillary industries, like cybersecurity, to support the growing electronic banking sphere. Smaller companies will struggle to survive in this increasingly cashless environment."

As the economy expands, consumers will more readily spend money, stimulating the circulation of cash and checks. But surging inflation and supply chain disruptions may continue to inhibit spending. More businesses will also accept cash payments as the risk of COVID-19 infection becomes an afterthought for many vaccinated individuals. Consequently, more consumers will use ATMs, and retailers and other businesses will hold greater amounts of cash. This trend will resuscitate."

Leading conglomerates in the increasingly concentrated banking sector will continue to use their size to negotiate better contracts with providers, mitigating growth. Moreover, to boost profit, many banks will reduce the number of branches they run, especially amid the increasing popularity of online banking. As a result, the industry will have fewer locations to service, reducing contract size and revenue. Even so, the reduction in the number of bank branches may lead to more-efficient routes, reducing costs for providers."
