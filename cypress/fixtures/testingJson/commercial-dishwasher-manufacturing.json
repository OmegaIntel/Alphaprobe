In addition, tariffs implemented over the period added volatility in trade patterns, which also resulted in fluctuations in industry sales. For example, the threat of tariffs led domestic distributors to frontload imports in 2017 and purchase fewer domestically made products. Consequently, industry revenue declined 1.5% that year. Then, steel and aluminum tariffs raised industry costs and prices, leading to price hikes and 7.3% revenue growth in 2018. The COVID-19 pandemic has created unfavorable economic conditions in 2020, decreasing consumer spending."
