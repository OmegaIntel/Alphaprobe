PET (positron emission tomography) scanner purchases are infrequent and represent a significant capital investment for buyers. Prior to the current period, industry revenue boomed as downstream markets renewed and replaced old devices, and therefore, revenue declined early during the period as demand waned. However, PET scanner usage among oncologists has remained high because these scanners are used to diagnose a variety of cancers.",
