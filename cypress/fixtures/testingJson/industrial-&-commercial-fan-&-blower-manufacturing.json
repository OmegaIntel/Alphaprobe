Companies in this industry manufacture fans, blowers and other air ventilation equipment for industrial, commercial and aerospace settings. Therefore, industry demand is supported by growth in the manufacturing, construction and utilities sectors. After experiencing inflated growth prior to the current period due to the manufacturing sector's rapid recovery following the recession, industry revenue has declined. As recovery has slowed and the economy has reached prerecession levels, revenue has weakened throughout the manufacturing sector.",
