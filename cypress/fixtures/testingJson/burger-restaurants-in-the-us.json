    "executive_summary": "The Burger Restaurants industry has performed well over the past five years as per capita disposable income increased, providing consumers will spend more money to eat away from home. Although the industry experienced increased competition from the broader food service market, burger restaurants still represent the market's largest segment, especially among limited-service restaurants. However, economic slowdowns caused by the COVID-19 pandemic somewhat decreased burger demand. Nevertheless, burgers were highly demanded as a takeout food when a large share of the population stayed home. Industry revenue recovered in 2021 as the government eased COVID-19 restrictions. Consequently, industry revenue is anticipated to grow at a CAGR of 4.1% to $170.1 billion over the past five years, including an expected 2.4% growth in 2023 alone.",

            "current_performance_point_description": "Since the food service sector was considered essential, burger restaurants remained open throughout the pandemic. However, they could only offer pick-up and delivery services. The convenience and low prices of most burger offerings prevented industry revenue from falling at a much sharper rate. Most large budget chains experienced a spike in delivery orders as customers refrained from traveling to the stores. To mitigate decreases in dine-in sales, several burger companies partnered with Uber Eats to offer free delivery for a short period."

To accommodate these changes, burger restaurants have started altering their menus and offering a more comprehensive range of burgers. Many burger restaurants are now more transparent about the nutritional content of their food. This allows customers to make informed choices about what they eat."

Historically fast food burger patties are shipped and delivered partially cooked and frozen, making them easy to transport and store without substantial fear of the meat spoiling. However, red meat alternatives like chicken and turkey do not freeze and reheat as well as their beef counterparts because of their lower fat contents."

As other styles and concepts like health-focused and chicken-based restaurants, have grown much faster than burger restaurants, they have attracted a larger number of new entrants. The increasing demand for alternative burgers has led to an influx of new entrants, including startups and established food companies. This increased competition makes it more difficult for traditional burger restaurants to compete."
