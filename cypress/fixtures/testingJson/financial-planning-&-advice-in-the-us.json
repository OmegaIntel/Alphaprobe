The industry comprises advisors and planners that provide financial advice in conjunction with other activities such as portfolio management, protection planning and brokerage services for households, businesses and governments. Advisors generate revenue through management fees taken as a percentage of assets under management (AUM) and a variety of other administrative fees. Affluent families tend to have a greater need for financial planning services, leading to increased demand for operators' services.",

Over the five years to 2027, revenue is expected to grow at an annualized rate of 0.5% to $60.9 billion. Similarly, steady AUM in the period is expected to lead to slightly improve industry profit."
