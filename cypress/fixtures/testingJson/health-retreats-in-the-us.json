    "executive_summary": "Since health retreats are part of the service sector, revenue is primarily influenced by changes in total recreation expenditure, leisure time and the number of domestic trips. COVID-19 made it impossible for health retreats to operate effectively because of pandemic restrictions. At the same time, fears about getting the virus caused demand for spas and the total number of domestic trips to drop significantly. These factors caused revenue to crater in 2020. As the US economy opened up, consumers started using the excess cash they received from COVID-19 subsidies, resulting in higher recreation expenditure, more domestic travel and higher corporate profit, causing downstream demand for health retreats to skyrocket. Recessionary fears have recently hampered revenue growth as concerns about future economic conditions have caused consumers to cut back on fun spending.",

            "current_performance_point_description": "When the pandemic hit, state and local governments imposed temporary lockdowns and initiated social distancing measures. These provisions made it nearly impossible for health retreats to operate, severely reducing business for the industry. Demand for spas also plunged as households were afraid to catch the virus at health retreats. The number of domestic trips also fell dramatically as people didn't want to get COVID-19 on vacation, which hindered revenue growth. Struggles on the supply and demand sides caused revenue to fall by nearly half in 2020."

This includes a 0.6% rise in that year. Profit has responded to shifts in revenue growth. When downstream demand plunged during the pandemic recovery, profit declined significantly. As the economy opened up, profit displayed a big jump. Volatility will decline during the outlook period as stable economic conditions will foster revenue growth."

            "future_outlook_point_description": "As the US economy opened up, more individuals used COVID-19 relief funds to splurge on fun activities, causing total recreation expenditure to soar. Some of this increased spending was devoted to spas, which benefited the industry. Concerns about catching the virus also abated, causing families to take more vacations. More households ended up at health retreats, aiding revenue growth. High consumer spending caused corporate profit to soar during the recovery. High corporate profit gave companies the funds to send their employees on health retreats, so demand from businesses also significantly increased during the recovery."

The elevated cost of borrowing has threatened to hinder consumption, raising the possibility of a recession in the near future. Households have become more conservative with their spending as they fear bad times may be coming. The rate of growth in recreation expenditure and the number of domestic trips have slowed down as a result, constraining revenue growth. High-interest rates have also made it more expensive for businesses to afford their existing obligations, eating into their profit. Lower corporate profit has caused businesses to fund fewer health retreats, which has also reduced revenue growth recently."

Rising GDP will cause wages to expand, causing per capita disposable income to grow. Consumers will use more of their income to spend on fun activities and take more vacations, increasing demand for the industry's services. Steady economic growth will also cause corporate profit to jump, giving companies more funds to spend on health retreats for their employees. Higher tax revenue will give more funds to government agencies, causing demand from the public sector to also rise."

As more time is eaten up by work, the time spent on leisure and sports will remain stagnant despite higher spending on recreational activities. Since households will need to make more difficult decisions about what recreational activities to engage in because of time constraints, some individuals will forego going on health retreats, hindering revenue growth somewhat."

As virtual reality and digital technology capabilities continue to emerge, many players are also increasingly adopting these systems to assist with their operations. These purchases include smart sleep technology, fitness equipment and artificial intelligence (AI) systems. While high inflation has caused purchase costs to soar, health retreats have been able to negotiate with their suppliers since concentration is low upstream. As a result, purchases' revenue share has held pretty steady during the current period."

COVID-19 made it impossible for most spas to operate effectively, so revenue plunged. Demand for the industry's services soared during the pandemic recovery as rising incomes and fully operating retreats enabled individuals to use spas at record levels. These shifts have caused revenue volatility to be extremely high during the current period."
