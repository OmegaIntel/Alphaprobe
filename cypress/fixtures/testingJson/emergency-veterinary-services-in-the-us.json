    "executive_summary": "Emergency veterinary services provide care to livestock, equines and domesticated animals. As pet insurance coverage has soared, animal care utilization has increased, raising demand for emergency veterinary services and boosting revenue growth. Strong wage growth in the years immediately preceding the pandemic boosted per capita disposable income. This enabled households to spend more on laboratory tests and other forms of treatment when they took their pets to their local clinic, raising demand for the industry's services. Individuals didn't go out much during the pandemic since stadiums, businesses, bars and other establishments were closed, so people became very lonely. Loneliness increased the number of pets, which increased spending on emergency veterinary visits and caused revenue to rise in 2020.",

            "current_performance_point_title": "Soaring Demand for Pet Insurance Has Been a Boon for the Industry",
            "current_performance_point_description": "As interest rates have increased, it's become more expensive for farmers to afford essential equipment. They've rationed veterinary services to pay for farm equipment and barns, so demand for the industry's services from livestock has declined in 2022, causing revenue to also fall. Overall, revenue for emergency veterinary service providers is anticipated to surge at a CAGR of 5.6% during the current period, reaching $14.0 billion in 2023. Revenue is expected to increase 5.4% in that year."

            "current_performance_point_description": "The US economy was in a long-term expansion in the late 2010s, as it was in the final stages of recovery from the financial crisis of 2008. Soaring GDP growth enabled corporate profit to rise, boosting wage growth. Since consumers had higher incomes, they were willing to allocate more resources toward healthcare for their pets, raising demand for veterinary services. Although households seeking emergency veterinary services need the care for their pets, higher incomes enable these individuals to spend more on extraneous services (e.g., laboratory tests) than they otherwise would have if they had less money, so rising wages still benefited this industry."

            "current_performance_point_title": "Loneliness Was a Major Problem During COVID-19",
            "current_performance_point_description": "When the pandemic hit, state and local governments forced nonessential businesses to shut down and individuals were advised to stay at home as much as possible to reduce the risk of spreading or catching the virus. Since people were mostly stuck at home and interaction with other humans outside was limited, loneliness soared during the pandemic. To cope with being alone, many individuals purchased pets. When the number of pets rose, animal health issues increased, boosting demand for emergency veterinary services and raising revenue in 2020. When the economy opened up during the pandemic recovery, individuals could interact with other humans more readily again, so demand for pets declined, constraining revenue growth."

            "current_performance_point_description": "As inflation has soared, the Federal Reserve has been increasing interest rates to bring down rising prices. The higher cost of borrowing has made it more difficult for farmers to purchase equipment, rent barns and pay for some materials. Farmers must purchase equipment and other essential materials, so they've been cutting out extraneous parts of their budget to cope with higher interest rates. While veterinary care for livestock is essential for farmers, it's not as vital as equipment, so they've been using first-aid instead of going to the vet to treat their farm animals. Since first-aid is a substitute for emergency veterinary services, higher interest rates have contributed to declining revenue recently."

Consistent economic growth will boost consumer spending and corporate profit, making wage growth robust. Rising wages will cause per capita disposable income to increase, enabling households to purchase a slew of extra goods and services. Since individuals have more money, they'll be willing to spend more on helping their pet during an emergency visit to the veterinarian. Consumers will also refrain from applying first-aid to their livestock and pets to save money, so they'll decide to go to their local animal doctor instead. These factors will aid revenue growth during the outlook period."

Demand for pets will display a resurgence during the outlook period, as it will continue to become commonplace for a family to have a cat, dog or another type of domesticated animal. The number of households will increase as the population rises. More families create more demand for pets. Higher incomes will also encourage households to get a cat or a dog, as they can more easily afford a pet with more money coming in. When families have more pets, the total number of health issues animals face rises, increasing spending on emergency veterinary services and boosting revenue during the outlook period."

            "future_outlook_point_description": "To compete with other practices, veterinary clinics will start to offer treatments previously used only for humans. Practices will use laser technology more readily, making cutting more precise. The treatment reduces bleeding, tissue damage and helps animals heal faster, so employing laser technology will make veterinary clinics more attractive to customers. Veterinarians will also start to use endoscopy on animals. Endoscopy enables doctors to see internal organs without surgery by inserting a long and flexible tube into a pet's body. Endoscopy will enable veterinarians to treat some animal health issues much more painlessly and quickly, increasing the number of customers clinics can see within a specific time period. These new treatments will raise efficiency for veterinary practices, increasing revenue for the industry."

The Animal Welfare Act (AWA) requires breeders that sell more than 25 animals per year to receive a license, imposing a heavy barrier to entry on the industry. Animal rights groups will continue to push for more regulations and raise awareness about the cruelty of dog and pet breeding. These efforts will put breeders out of business, so revenue for pet and dog breeders will fall during the outlook period. Since animal breeding will decline, the number of pets will fall, reducing demand for emergency veterinary services and constraining revenue for the industry."
