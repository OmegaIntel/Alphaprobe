    "executive_summary": "Figures have been adjusted for inflation and are presented in 2024 currency. The Door Lock and Lockset Manufacturing industry has struggled through 2024, with increased international competition and offshoring alongside weak demand from key downstream markets. In particular, the collapse of the residential construction sector following the pandemic slashed demand in the latter half of the period. Many companies have also offshored operations, resulting in greater import penetration. Given that the industry derives most of its demand from the construction, home improvement, and furniture markets, the downturn in residential construction activity amplified the strain from rising import penetration. Also, the industry declined in 2020 during the COVID-19 pandemic, though strong demand from home improvement stores because of do-it-yourself (DIY) trends stabilized the market. Door Lock and Lockset Manufacturing industry revenue has contracted at a CAGR of 2.4% over the past five years and is expected to total $5.0 billion in 2024, when revenue will jump by an estimated 1.3%.",
