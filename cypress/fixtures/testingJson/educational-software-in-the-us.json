Publishers provide their services to various public and private educational institutions. These institutions use software to help educators assist with multiple subjects, including language arts, mathematics and science. The onset of the pandemic significantly accelerated growth in this sector, with many schools implementing a remote learning policy and embracing online software solutions. Nonetheless, the shift towards software adoption has been an ongoing trend, reinforced by recent circumstances. Publishing revenue grew at a CAGR of 1.0% to $1.2 billion through 2024, including 3.7% in 2024 alone, as profitability remains elevated.",
