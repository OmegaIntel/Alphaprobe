Measures like social distancing and labor shortages forced these industries to scale back operations, diminishing the need for new machinery. Additionally, global supply chain disruptions caused delays in raw material and component deliveries. The industry also faced elevated volatility due to fluctuating commodity prices, which, while increasing production costs, contributed to notable revenue growth between 2021 and 2022.",
