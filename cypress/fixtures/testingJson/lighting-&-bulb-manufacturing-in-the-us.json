    "executive_summary": "The lighting and bulb manufacturing industry has struggled over the past two decades, with consistent declines and occasional upticks in demand. Unfavorable economic conditions, increased efficiency standards, and rising electric power prices have weakened the traditional lighting sector. The COVID-19 pandemic forced many companies to close, harming demand from construction and manufacturing, lowering bulb sales. Revenue has been sinking at an estimated CAGR of 8.3% to $993.9 million through 2024, with a 4.0% gain that year. Domestic manufacturers face high competition from foreign imports, accounting for over half of domestic demand. However, exports are also declining as countries focus on energy-efficient solutions. The influx of lower-cost imports and reduced exports could cause domestic producers to lower prices, pressuring profits. LEDs are taking over as a substitute, with rapid growth, falling prices, and energy-efficient technology. More companies and consumers will adopt digitalization and green initiatives, with individual companies strategically including LED products. However, rising semiconductor prices may slow the decreasing revenue growth rate. As a result, revenue is expected to decline at a smaller CAGR of 0.3% to $977.7 million through 2029.",

LED bulb costs have decreased due to technology and manufacturing improvements, encouraging manufacturers to switch industries. Substantial hikes in electric power costs since 2019 have heightened abandonment of traditional options as consumers switch to LEDs. Many downstream markets like automobile manufacturers are switching to LEDs to meet efficiency standards and cut costs."

The pandemic led to volatility impacting the construction sector and contributing to a drastic drop in sales and shrinking revenue. Growing inflation, decreasing consumer confidence, and weak corporate profit during the pandemic discouraged construction activities, pushing down demand for new bulbs and manufacturer revenue. Improving domestic economic conditions have enabled demand recovery as the growing economy boosts construction projects and manufactured product demand."

In 2024, the Biden administration finalized a new efficiency standard increasing the requirement from 45 to over 120 lumens per watt, which producers must comply with starting in 2028, encouraging a shift towards LEDs and phasing out less-efficient traditional bulbs. Strained trade with China and supply chain issues have sparked changes in US industrial policy like the CHIPS Act to boost domestic LED production, harming traditional manufacturers."

Residential and overall construction value will likely bounce back as economic conditions recover from high interest rates, boosting traditional lighting demand. Although supporting traditional manufacturers, widespread LED adoption and tightened regulations will shift the industry toward energy-efficient manufacturers, diminishing conventional lighting products."
