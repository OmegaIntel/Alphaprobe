    "executive_summary": "Human resources and benefits administration providers have recently benefited from growing corporate profit, higher employment and rising consumer spending, encouraging companies to outsource administrative duties. Earlier in the period, the emergence of COVID-19 in 2020 caused high unemployment, limiting demand for the industry's services. Despite pandemic-related declines, revenue flourished in 2021 and 2022 as companies recovered from the economic downturn. Revenue growth has slowed recently because of high-interest rates and falling per capita disposable income.",

            "current_performance_point_description": "As the pandemic and related shutdowns impacted the economy, many businesses were forced to permanently close their storefronts, limiting the pool of clients. Other businesses and organizations cut off the industry's services, hoping to lower overhead costs while weathering the downturn. Pandemic aid and legislation, such as the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP), Economic Injury Disaster Loans (EIDL) and enhanced unemployment benefit programs made administering employee benefits more complex, increasing demand for the industry's services. As a result, revenue declined only slightly in 2020."

The industry has also built web-based platforms that enable employees to request time off, access pay stubs, update personal details and engage in other functions. One company that specializes in these functions is Automatic Data Processing, Inc. (ADP). Artificial intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) systems have also been added to identify talent, predict employee turnover, screen job applicants and personalize benefits packages to suit an employee's needs. Adopting these technologies has made human resources and benefits administration more efficient and attractive, attracting customers and aiding revenue growth."

            "current_performance_point_description": "Businesses more heavily view outsourcing as an adequate means to manage non-core administrative duties while the company concentrates on core missions. Businesses have also sought help with increasingly complex compliance and regulation. Duties such as payroll processing, human resources, customer service and even IT maintenance can be effectively outsourced, freeing up valuable internal resources for core business functions. Large and mid-sized businesses have especially had the incentive to outsource HR services since they have the funds to do so. This has given them a competitive advantage over smaller players in their industries since big companies can hone their resources and time into primary functions. Increased outsourcing has raised demand for human resources and benefits administrators, helping revenue expand during the current period."

            "current_performance_point_description": "Record-high inflation has groped the US economy as supply chain disruptions, loose monetary policy and massive government spending caused prices to soar. The Federal Reserve has raised interest rates to tame rising prices. The high cost of borrowing has made it more difficult for businesses to invest in land, buildings and other forms of equipment. Since capital investment is essential for the functioning of many corporations, some businesses have scaled back human resources programs to ensure they can afford to pay higher interest rates on equipment. Many companies have reduced their investment in third-party human resources and benefits administration service providers or started producing essential services entirely in-house. This has caused revenue growth to slow recently. Per capita disposable income has also declined as government subsidies have stopped, hindering demand from households and contributing to the slowdown in revenue growth."

Solid economic conditions will increase employment, corporate profit, the number of businesses and access to credit. Smaller companies view the industry as a luxury \u2013 they will only contract with human resources and benefits administrations when business is stable. Since corporate profit will rise during the outlook period, small businesses will have the funds to outsource human resources and benefits administration to the industry, aiding revenue growth. As economic growth causes the number of businesses to expand, providers will be swarmed by a wave of new clients looking to expand. In particular, the number of temporary employees is set to swell, creating constant demand for training services and benefits administration \u2013 two of the industry's largest segments."

            "future_outlook_point_description": "Large businesses often prefer a blanket solution, outsourcing numerous tasks to a single firm that can handle their work. This includes wide-reaching administrative tasks such as paperwork, documentation and legal issues. Delegating these responsibilities helps big corporations focus on their core business activities. Providers in this market often need to offer supplementary services, including tax preparation, accounting and payroll and bookkeeping services. Many smaller administrators don't have the resources to handle these issues, creating a disparity between players. High corporate profit will keep demand from large businesses elevated. Since major human resources and benefits administration service providers have the resources to service big corporations, they'll remain relevant as spending from large businesses remains high."

Human resources and benefits administrators may be forced to invest in new technology or lose clients. Despite the importance of adopting new systems, many smaller companies will view software services as a luxury instead of a necessity since it's difficult to afford software upgrades, new computers and better services. While the increased importance of new software and technology will benefit larger players, concentration will still decline during the outlook period. Growth in the number of businesses, higher corporate profit and soaring employment will increase the number of revenue streams, encouraging entry into the industry and causing establishments and enterprises to rise at a much faster pace than revenue."

With the help of HR software, internal HR teams are improving, reducing the need for the industry's services. Large HR service providers will respond to this threat by investing in cloud-based HR software solutions. Cloud-based software can be accessed anywhere with an internet connection. Since cloud-based solutions are more convenient, they save businesses time and resources, making them more cost-competitive. This feature is particularly attractive to small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). Despite these investments, companies can expect increased pressure on revenues as homemade HR software gains traction. Specifically, private sector customers will likely address HR-related issues using software."
