    "executive_summary": "Revenue for business service centers has been volatile during the current period. When COVID-19 hit, demand for the industry's services was constrained by the shutdown of many physical service centers and falling corporate profit. Despite this, soaring e-commerce sales boosted demand from retailers and other sellers of goods and services, causing revenue to rise in 2020. As the economy recovered from the pandemic, e-commerce sales plunged, damaging the industry's performance. As higher corporate profit slowly raised investment from businesses, revenue rose in 2022. Rising interest rates have constrained consumer spending, heightening recessionary fears. These fears have caused more businesses to save more money for a rainy day, hindering spending on the industry's services.",
