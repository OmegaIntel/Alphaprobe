    "executive_summary": "Figures have been adjusted for inflation and are presented in 2022 currency.\n\nThe Private Detective Services industry offers investigation services, including surveillance, fraud investigation and pre-employment screening, to both private citizens and corporate entities. Operators in this industry do not provide patrol or security guard services. The industry performed relatively well over much of the five years to 2020, as the growing economy enabled businesses and consumers to enlist the wide range of services provided by industry operators. Corporate profit and per capita disposable income growth enabled businesses and households to boost spending on discretionary services like those provided by industry operators. However, the outbreak of the COVID-19 (coronavirus) pandemic negatively affected the industry in 2020, as a large economic contraction led to a sharp decline in downstream demand. While this temporarily limited demand, the recovery of the economy since has returned the industry to growth. Consequently, IBISWorld expects industry revenue to grow at an annualized rate of 1.0% to $7.3 billion over the five years to 2022, including 2.1% growth during the current year.",

Whether it be for litigation or with the purpose of simply gathering information, private detective services help businesses by collecting information that is unavailable through other channels. Following a contraction in 2020, corporate profit surged more than 20.0% in 2021. As a result, industry profit, defined as earnings before interest and taxes, has recovered and is expected to reach 5.5% of revenue in 2022."

            "current_performance_point_title": "Industry revenue expected to grow at 1.7% annually over next 5 years",
            "current_performance_point_description": "Over the five years to 2027, industry revenue is expected to grow at an annualized rate of 1.7% to total $7.9 billion. Rising corporate profit, as well as increases in per capita disposable income and the number of businesses, are expected to drive this growth, as both consumers and businesses become better equipped to afford industry services. Growing downstream demand is expected to counter continued growth in labor costs, causing profit to stagnate. However, declining divorce and crime rates are expected to limit growth during the period because these are crucial drivers for the industry. Regardless, improving economic conditions and the continued rise in the popularity of pre-employment screening will outweigh negative trends and drive growth."

Furthermore, the number of businesses is forecast to increase at an annualized rate of 0.9% over the next five years. An increasing number of businesses will likely boost expenditure on legal- and business-related private detective services."

Per capita disposable income is expected to rise at an annualized rate of 1.7% over the five years to 2027. Increasing levels of income are expected to influence consumers' desire to use industry services. However, the divorce rate, which measures the number of divorces per 1,000 people, is expected to decline at an annualized rate of 4.1% over the five years to 2027. This rate coincides closely with consumer demand for industry services since consumers that suspect infidelity often use private detectives to gather information."
