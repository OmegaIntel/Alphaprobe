Subsequently, consumers returned to the marketplace amid the reopening economy faster than supply chains could recuperate, creating excess demand for hand tools relative to supply. Low interest rates and a tight housing market prompted widespread construction investment, putting more pressure on prices at the onset of the current period. Hand tool manufacturers were not able to take advantage of skyrocketing prices because more sales couldn't completely offset costs from high wages and input prices, namely aluminum. In the last few years, revenue fell at a CAGR of 2.1% to $10.8 billion, including an expected 3.9% decline in 2024.",

Imports from China, the largest hand tool importer, began rising as US producers faced factory closures in late 2020 and early 2021. Hand tool manufacturers struggled to compete under high input costs and strict pandemic protocols. Price hikes put enormous pressure on hand tool manufacturers \u2013 for example, steel prices shot up around the world in the wake of the pandemic. Companies hiked hand tool prices and ramped up production to take advantage of high price tags. Mass hiring and a labor shortage made wage expenditures another challenge."

Hand tool prices shot through the roof along with rebounding sales. Many consumers \u2013 and companies \u2013 had massive pent-up demand that imports couldn't satisfy. Low mortgage rates at the onset of the period and few houses up for sale created outsized demand for homes. Home prices soared and construction companies looked to take advantage, prompting massive hiring campaigns and investment in hand tools. But hand tools faced the same supply shortage as houses at the time, leading to even higher tool prices."

The national unemployment rate will rise as it normalizes and pressure household spending on things like hand tools, kitchen utensils and razors. Mortgage rates rise alongside the Fed's interest rate hikes, limiting widespread housing starts and consumers' ability to stock up on home goods like kitchen utensils and home repair tools.

Factories can't expand as quickly and financing new equipment will cost too much to justify the substantial investment. The US has set out to reduce import competition for critical technologies, like semiconductors. The government will list political allies as key trading partners and restrict China, hand tool manufacturers' most significant trading partner. Hand tool manufacturers will find export opportunities in Mexico and Canada thanks to trade partnerships. Imports from Asian manufacturing powerhouses will continue to satisfy more than one-half of domestic demand because of their price competitiveness."
