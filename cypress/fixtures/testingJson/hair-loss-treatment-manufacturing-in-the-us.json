    "executive_summary": "The proliferation of low-cost generic oral hair loss treatments in recent years has made such treatments more accessible. However, the prevalence of generic products has intensified competitive price pressures, adversely affecting industry revenue. Furthermore, demand for hair loss treatments declined in 2020 because of COVID-19. Also, consumer confidence has dropped for most of the period and soaring inflation has caused interest rates to skyrocket. So, industry-wide revenue has been decreasing at a CAGR of 2.0% over the past five years, including an estimated 3.3% increase in the current year, and is expected to total $3.8 billion in 2023. In the same year, profit is projected to plateau to 9.6%.",
