Demand for these services depends on the level of activity in downstream livestock industries and these markets' propensities to outsource support services to external companies. Rising per capita meat consumption has encouraged many livestock farmers to increase levels of production, while strong fed livestock prices have further aided growth in these downstream industries. Over the past five years, industry revenue has been falling at a CAGR of 1.1% and is expected to reach $5.1 billion in 2023, when revenue is projected to fall to 2.1%.",

            "question": "Are your sales dependent on the overall health of the economy?",
            "answer": "Rising overall incomes will enable downstream customers to better afford the purchase of livestock support services, particularly those services for equines. When agricultural prices are low, livestock support service providers will see a decline in demand due to a lack of affordability."
        },
        {
            "question": "Does your company specialize in one corner of the market or operate in a diverse range of industry segments?",
            "answer": "Cross-segment competition can be extremely high and often cost-prohibitive. Most livestock support service providers will specialize in one type of service, such as sheep shearing in order to maximize returns. However, overexposure to just one downstream market is how many operators have suffered during the pandemic due to a downturn in said market as a result of COVID-19. Membership organizations such as the Missouri Pork Association, the National Cattlemen's Beef Association and the American Quarter Horse Association represent the interests of livestock farmers. These organizations help maintain the health of major downstream industries, ensuring a viable market for livestock support service providers."
        },
        {
            "question": "How does volatility of input prices affect your operations?",
            "answer": "Increases in the price of agricultural inputs will constrain demand for livestock support services. Low agricultural prices can stymie demand because downstream farmers are not optimistic about future conditions, potentially cutting herd numbers and weakening demand for industry services."
        },
        {
            "question": "Is your company located in proximity to key downstream markets?",
            "answer": "Operators located near downstream markets and end customers will be afforded cost savings. Operators that are not located near key end markets will not have consistent demand for their services. Overall, it is uncompetitive for industry operators to compete with one another outside of specific service locales."
        },
        {
            "question": "How is your company leveraging new technologies?",
            "answer": "Service providers that adopt the most recent technologies will exhibit efficiency gains and labor cost savings. Advanced tagging technology can provide full medical histories of livestock, reducing clerical error and streamlining operations."
        },
        {
            "question": "Does your company utilize electronic data interchange technology?",
            "answer": "Service providers that adopt electronic data management systems will exhibit higher operational efficiencies. Electronic data management software can encourage strong supply chain management, protecting service providers from future cost increases."
        },
        {
            "question": "Have you had any regulatory expenses that have significantly impacted profitability?",
            "answer": "Service providers that do not comply with regulations surrounding organic food production are subject to severe fines and penalties. Noncompliant operators will damage public perceptions, hindering revenue growth."
        },
        {
            "question": "How does your company stay ahead of the shifting regulatory landscape?",

        {
            "question": "How do your company's profit margins compare to those of your competitors?",
            "answer": "Profit margins vary by segment and service providers that specialize in one particular industry segment will see wider margins. Service providers that enter into long-term supply contracts will have more stable revenue and lower purchase costs, increasing profit margins."
        },
        {
            "question": "How does your company compensate for the seasonality of cash flows?",
            "answer": "Demand for livestock support services is cyclical and seasonal. Service providers that switch between operations will have more consistent business. Service providers operating in just one segment will exhibit revenue declines when seasonal demand slackens."
        },
        {
            "question": "How does your establishment attract customers? How do you monitor your customers' satisfaction levels? How do you respond to customer complaints?",
            "answer": "A good reputation is important for any company providing support services because referrals are an important source of demand. Overall, industry operators who provide strong services and a quality reputation will succeed since most services are considered substitutable by any other industry operator."

        {
            "question": "What trends in meat consumption have you noticed? How can your company adapt when per capita meat consumption is low?",

        },
        {
            "question": "What is the biggest input cost for your company? What impact does the price of feed have on your company's funds for industry services?",
            "answer": "High feed costs will erode demand for industry services due to the fact that farmers are expending more resources on animal feed."
