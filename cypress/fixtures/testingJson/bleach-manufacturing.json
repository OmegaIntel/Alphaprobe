    "executive_summary": "Over the five years to 2021, declining domestic demand and slow export growth were momentarily reversed by the outbreak and spread of the COVID-19 (coronavirus) pandemic, driving revenue growth for the Bleach Manufacturing industry. Bleach products are a staple good for household cleaning and laundry. As a result, demand for bleach has historically moved closely in line with general consumer spending and population growth. Liquid household bleach, however, has experienced competition from proliferating bleach alternatives, which are not included in the industry. Nevertheless, industry revenue surged to growth as a result of a large increase in consumer demand for disinfectant products, including bleach. Likewise, business customers like restaurants, hotels and janitorial services increased their purchases of bleach products as a result of an emphasis on sanitation. Industry revenue is thus expected to rise at an annualized rate of 2.4% to $1.3 billion over the five years to 2021, including expected growth of 5.5% in 2021 alone.",

To some extent, most industries require bleach for basic cleaning purposes. However, the use of bleach products is greatest among industries such as the Hotels and Motels industry and the Chain Restaurants industry, which use bleach products in large quantities to meet regulations and customer preferences for cleanliness. Likewise, the Janitorial Services industry uses bleach products to perform cleaning services for a variety of commercial and residential clients."

Sudden changes in supplier relationships, particularly as less-expensive imports enter the domestic market, could have a substantial negative effect on industry companies."
