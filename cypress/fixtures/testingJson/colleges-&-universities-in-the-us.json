In 2021, these institutions enjoyed a staggering 684.0% jump in investment returns as a result of robust recovery from the pandemic and manageable interest rates. In contrast, public universities, which typically hold smaller endowments invested more in US equities and fixed-income assets, experienced more modest gains. Meanwhile, inflation and rising interest rates in 2022 reversed the boom for private nonprofits, while public universities' endowments showed resilience, stabilizing returns because of their focus on fixed-income assets.",

        "Revenue skyrocketed in the wake of the pandemic. Significant government stimulus, high corporate profit, rising tuition, staggering investment returns and the enrollment of recent graduates and those who took a gap year pushed revenue through the roof in 2021.",
        "High interest rates discourage private contributions. Most colleges and universities are nonprofits that rely on generous donations from private individuals, but lingering high interest rates amid inflation encourage donors to keep their money invested.",
        "The student debt crisis is weighing on enrollment. Unconvincing job placement rates haven't eased consumers' concerns surrounding a college degree's return on investment. Price-sensitive consumers seeking job security have increasingly moved to external competitors, like trade schools and community colleges.",

        "Steady sources of government funding help universities to continue running, even when they're losing money. Schools in this industry don't operate for profit, so they also enjoy significant contributions from private donors and foundations.",
        "Technical schools pose a threat to the industry. Students more sensitive to price are often choosing more affordable trade schools, which often have more promising employment prospects after graduation.",
        "The performance of the equity market influences universities' endowment funds. Universities sometimes lose money when the stock market performs poorly. Private nonprofit schools have much larger endowments and are more exposed to private equity and hedge fund performance.",
