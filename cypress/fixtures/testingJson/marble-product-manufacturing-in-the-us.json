    "executive_summary": "Companies in this industry manufacture marble products for construction, renovation and landscaping. Businesses benefited from high wages and low unemployment, as it caused aggregate private investment to swell. Higher private investment enabled companies to spend more on nonresidential construction, boosting downstream demand for the industry. Private investment fell during the COVID-19 pandemic, which depressed revenue in 2020. Manufacturers still benefited from low interest rates during the pandemic, as it accelerated housing starts and encouraged spending on home improvement. Rates have risen in recent years as the Federal Reserve has been combatting inflation, causing demand for housing to dwindle and reducing a revenue stream for manufacturers. The appreciating US dollar has also constrained exports, creating more challenges for manufacturers.",

This boosted demand for marble products, as this material is used to construct countertops and flooring. Also, as people spent more time at home, they were encouraged to invest in home improvements. Per capita disposable income rose, which prompted this investing spree, including the implementation of marble products as people looked to repair or embellish their homes."

To address rising prices, the Federal Reserve has been increasing interest rates. This has caused borrowing costs to surge, making purchasing homes or undertaking home improvements more expensive. Consequently, there has been a decline in demand for marble products, which has limited revenue growth in the industry."

This has reduced the number of products manufacturers can ship to other countries, reducing business revenue streams. The US dollar has also appreciated, which has made domestically produced goods more expensive to foreign buyers, reducing exports and sales for manufacturers."
