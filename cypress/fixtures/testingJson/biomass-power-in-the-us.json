External competition from natural gas and alternative renewable energy sources hindered revenue throughout the period. However, most states have enacted renewable portfolio standards (RPSs), which require local utilities to generate electricity from renewable power as a percentage of their total energy portfolio. In addition, new production tax credits (PTC) were implemented, limiting revenue declines over the past five years. Over the past five years, revenue has slumped at a CAGR of 3.5% to $925.5 million, including an expected 0.2% decrease in 2023. Profit is expected to lag to 10.7% of revenue in 2023 from 17.3% in 2018.",

The federal production tax credit (PTC) gave biomass power-generation companies an income tax credit of 2.6 cents per kilowatt-hour (kWh) of energy produced for five years. This credit reduced the cost of transmitting energy from biomass power plants, limiting falling demand and profit.

The world price of steaming coal and natural gas are expected to decline over the next five years, increasing competition for biomass power operators. Existing biomass power producers are expected to consolidate, creating larger players that can exploit economies of scale. This, in turn, will reduce variable costs and increase the number of long-term contracts with downstream energy providers.
