Fiber optic cable manufacturers have benefited from the growing reliance on services offered online, including Internet of Things (IoT) connected devices, and rising demand for high-speed internet from households and businesses. Telecommunications companies have invested heavily in improving their digital infrastructures and giving customers advantages in terms of speed, reliability and cost savings. Similarly, manufacturers have benefited from growing spending on infrastructure from the Bipartisan Infrastructure Act, which jumpstarted growth in 2021 following drastic pandemic losses. As a result, revenue has been falling at an estimated CAGR of 0.5% to $3.8 billion through the end of 2024, including a 3.8% jump that year alone.",
