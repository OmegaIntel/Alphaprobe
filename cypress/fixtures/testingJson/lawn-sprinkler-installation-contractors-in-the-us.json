This market encompasses investments in office buildings, hotels, hospitals, factories, power plants, stores, schools and entertainment centers such as golf courses and stadiums. The economic fallout related to the COVID-19 pandemic significantly reduced activity within this sector, as new construction projects were halted or postponed due to government-mandated establishment closures. As the unemployment rate decreased following the widespread distribution of COVID-19 vaccines and the reopening of the economy, activity has rebounded.",

Offices and business establishments across the country were forced to close. Also, commercial building projects were either slowed, halted or ceased altogether. Work is often the last thing to be installed in a new structure, the stall in commercial construction over the pandemic has meant this market segment has taken longer to improve."

The residential market boomed amid the COVID-19 pandemic due to the urban flight of wealthy Americans. Those who could afford it left densely populated areas and relocated to suburban or rural parts of the country, refurbishing old homes or building new ones. This buoyed industry revenue over the past five years, mitigating loss from diminished commercial activity."

For instance, a competing industry enterprise employs less than five individuals on average and there are very few industry companies that operate on a national basis. High fragmentation and low barriers to entry have contributed to heightened competition over the past years as new operators seek to gain a foothold in untapped geographics amid rising demand."

Both residential and commercial customers will demand energy efficient sprinkler systems to save costs and lessen their environmental impact, as well as to adjust to potential regulations. For instance, California adopted an efficiency standard for new spray sprinklers in the prior period that reduce irrigation system misting and overspray that is common around urban landscapes."

Repair work is often more resistant to economic fluctuations, as keeping sprinkler systems in working order is considered essential for a household's quality of life. Revenue from repairs and maintenance is steady and provides lawn sprinkler installers with a stable source of income. Once interest rates stabilize, residential work will resume, albeit at a greatly subdued rate and with less volatility compared with the prior period."
