Although operators remain a popular destination for common hair extension implementation such as weaves, the overall industry remains highly susceptible to economic volatility and is dependent on steady consumer demand to ensure growth. With COVID-19 and the subsequent inflationary pressures that followed, operator demand was severely harmed, as declines in the Consumer confidence index and sharp swings in disposable income levels ate away at consumers' fiscal flexibility.",

Even as consumers struggled during COVID-19, the rapid reopening of hair extension servicers boosted recovery, with high pent-up demand among a wide range of customers playing a key role. In recent years, however, inflationary pressures continue to play a role in limiting larger growth, as fiscally-limited consumers are forced to look for less expensive alternatives."
