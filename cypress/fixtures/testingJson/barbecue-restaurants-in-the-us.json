    "executive_summary": "Barbeque restaurants experienced some volatility in the last few years. Prior to the outbreak of COVID-19 and its subsequent economic impact, BBQ restaurants were bolstered by growth. When the pandemic hit, restaurant owners were forced to curtail dine-in operations, contributing to a massive dip in revenue in 2020. An uptick in take-away orders sustained many establishments during this time. Recovery was swift, however, once the government lifted stay-at-home orders, leaving consumers eager to eat out again. Rising consumer spending throughout the last few years has been a driver behind a rise in consumers dining out. Demand for BBQ has grown, with the impact of the pandemic on revenue growth being relatively brief. Revenue grew at a CAGR of 1.5% to $4.9 billion over the last five years, including a rise of 2.9% in 2024 alone.",
