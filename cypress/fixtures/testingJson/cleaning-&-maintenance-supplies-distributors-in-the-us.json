    "executive_summary": "Cleaning and maintenance supplies distributors sell an array of products drawn from a wide range of markets, including janitorial service companies, commercial and industrial buildings, government buildings, and retail outlets. While demand for cleaning and maintenance supplies is relatively high, enterprises have fierce competition from online and big-box retailers. In the latter part of the period, distributors have experienced a pandemic-induced surge in industry demand due to a jump in the number of businesses. A jump in the number of businesses directly correlates to increased demand for industry services. Overall, industry revenue has climbed at a CAGR of 2.1% to $12.5 billion over the past five years, including a decline of 4.5% in 2024 alone.",
