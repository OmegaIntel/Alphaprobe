    "executive_summary": "Rising incomes and shifting consumer preferences have translated into revenue growth for health stores in recent years. More than ever, consumers value the importance of active and healthy lifestyles. At the same time, higher incomes allow people to integrate vitamins, supplements and other health products into their daily lives. While this has benefited health stores, mounting competition from alternative retailers is offsetting the growing popularity of health and wellness products. A booming health and wellness market has incentivized a range of alternative retailers, from popular beauty stores (Sephora, Ulta) to pharmacies and big-box retailers (Target, Walmart), to expand offerings of health products. Still, industry revenue is rising at a CAGR of 4.9%, reaching an estimated $47.4 billion in 2024, when revenue will jump an expected 1.0%.",

Still, overarching demand from the growing over-65 population and millennials will support spending on health products moving forward. But, more consumers are anticipated to purchase vitamins and supplements at retailers they already visit, like Target or Sephora, as these stores introduce more health and wellness items.

            "question": "Does your company specialize in one corner of the market or do you retail a diversified range of products?",
            "answer": "Health store products vary significantly, ranging from general vitamins to specific proteins and supplements for athletes. There is potential to appeal to a wide range of customers when companies diversify their product offerings."

        {
            "question": "Health stores are facing various forms of disruption, including e-commerce and big-box retailers, such as Target and Walmart. Do you differentiate through innovation? If not, how do you differentiate from competitors?",

        },
        {
            "question": "Has your company explored acquisition opportunities in order to expand reach to a broader customer base and reduce overhead expenses?",
            "answer": "By acquiring other companies, businesses can expand their offerings and appeal to a larger consumer base. Recently, Vitamin Shoppe was acquired by a private company based in China. However, the majority of small specialty retailers are single-store companies that serve a specific geographic area. As a result, merger and acquisition activity is less common in this industry compared to other retail industries."
        },
        {
            "question": "Many retailers have been able to implement technology, like automated customer service responses, to reduce labor. Have you been able to reduce wage costs through automation over the past five years?",
            "answer": "Unlike other retail industries, health stores require employees knowledgeable in fitness and nutrition to help customers find the right products, limiting the ability to reduce wage costs through automation."

            "question": "What does your company do to remain compliant with new consumer regulations, such as the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FDCA)?",
            "answer": "Health stores are subject to regulations by a number of federal agencies, including the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), the Consumer Product Safety Commission and the US Postal Service (USPS). Not all supplements are FDA-approved, meaning that the majority of products are subject to strict packaging rules that outline the risk of taking non-FDA-approved substances."
        },

        {
            "question": "Many retailers have increasingly implemented financing options through third-party applications, such as Afterpay, Quadpay and Klarna. Do you have any challenges with customers paying on time?",
            "answer": "The majority of health store products are small and discretionary, and so financing is typically not provided to customers. This means health stores don't usually run into problems with customers paying on time. However, as more retailers implement payment systems, there is a greater risk of customers not paying on time."
        },
        {
            "question": "Do you manufacture any branded products? How do you promote your products and services? How can you improve this process?",

        },
        {
            "question": "How do you respond to variability in consumer demand? Are you able to quickly and easily alter the services offered?",
            "answer": "Health stores must evaluate their offerings to meet consumer demands and differentiate themselves from competitors. It is particularly important when competing with mass retailers to ensure that a company's offerings don't overlap with the products of these competitors.
