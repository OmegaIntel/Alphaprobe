    "executive_summary": "As healthcare coverage has expanded and health expenditure has grown over the five years to 2021, demand for over-the-counter (OTC) allergy medicine has steadily increased. OTC allergy medicine includes products sold without a prescription that are meant to temporarily prevent or reduce the symptoms of mild-to-moderate allergic reactions. While OTC drugs typically do not have the same high costs as prescription drugs, rising pharmaceutical prices have contributed to industry product price increases. However, given the necessity of allergy medicine for people with allergies, demand for Allergy Medicine Manufacturing OTC industry products has remained strong. As a result, over the five years to 2021, industry revenue is expected to grow at an annualized rate of 0.1% to $3.6 billion, including an increase of 6.4% in 2021 alone as supply chain disruptions caused from COVID-19 (coronavirus) subside.",

OTC allergy medicine manufacturers produce medicines sold without a prescription that temporarily prevent or reduce the symptoms of mild-to-moderate allergic reactions. While these products are sold without a prescription, rising pharmaceutical prices have led to higher prices for industry products. However, allergy medicine is a necessity for many people, so demand is resistant to price increases."

Additionally, industry companies are likely to continue investing in research and development to try to improve the quality of industry products. As a result of these factors, over the five years to 2026, industry revenue is projected to increase at an annualized rate of 3.1% to $4.2 billion as COVID-19 (coronavirus)-related declines dissipate."
