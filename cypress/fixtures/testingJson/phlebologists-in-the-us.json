    "executive_summary": "Phlebologists experienced a turbulent period in 2020 as COVID-19 forced the reduction in elective and non-essential procedures. However, as vaccines were rolled out and restrictions eased, patient demand rebounded strongly, leading to a sharp recovery in profit. Phlebologists also learned that by managing wage costs and adopting systems to control their total wage bill, they could better position themselves to handle shortages and competition for skilled labor in the future. Despite the losses incurred during COVID-19, the industry has been growing at a CAGR of 0.3% and is anticipated to reach $2.5 billion in revenue in 2024, when revenue will jump by an estimated 0.3% and profit hits 14.0%.",

Public health directives resulted in a drastic reduction in elective and non-essential procedures like cosmetic surgeries, leading to a contraction in profit. Then, in the latter part of 2021, the vaccine rollout began and patient pent-up demand fostered a sharp recovery. As a result, profit steadily rose throughout the rest of the period, as wages contracted somewhat."

By expanding services to include medical cosmetics and laser treatments, phlebologists can attract a broader patient base and provide comprehensive care for functional and aesthetic concerns. Phlebologists can explore partnering with or hiring aestheticians or cosmetic nurses. By combining medical cosmetics, such as Botox or dermal fillers, with vein treatments, phlebologists can attract patients seeking an all-in-one solution for their aesthetic concerns."
