    "executive_summary": "In recent years, clinics have navigated a historic demand shock and abrupt regulatory transformation. Rapid growth stopped in 2020, resulting from the economic fallout caused by COVID-19. Luckily, the negative impact was mitigated by robust government funding. In the few years following the pandemic, economic conditions improved. Growth in per capita disposable income and healthy corporate profit supported out-of-pocket and private insurance payments for pent-up demand. However, the landscape shifted once again in 2022 with the US Supreme Court's decision to overturn Roe v. Wade, impacting states with trigger laws banning abortion services.",

The national unemployment rate spiked between 2019 and 2020, reducing the proportion of individuals with coverage under group plans and contributing to demand falloff. On June 24, 2022, the US Supreme Court overruled its 1973 landmark decision, Roe V. Wade, eliminating the constitutional right to abortion and transforming the US healthcare landscape. The ruling immediately impacted states with trigger laws, laws designed to ban or strictly restrict abortion if the court case was overturned."

But for clinics, wage growth can be attributed to labor shortages, competition for skilled professionals in the broader healthcare sector, along with increased pressures brought on by regulatory changes. Some industry organizations depend on volunteer labor, but their impact is limited as many volunteers lack the necessary skills for various services. Consequently, clinics need to allocate a significant portion of their budget to wages to recruit skilled professionals."

At the same time, the number of individuals with private health coverage is forecast to drop, hurting revenue. Per capita disposable income is expected to strengthen, increasing revenue from patient out-of-pocket expenses that represent almost one-quarter of revenue. As corporate profit expands, donations, gifts and grants that make up more than one-third of revenue are expected to increase, allowing companies to keep profit in the face of wage increases."

Following the ruling, the legality of abortion has been left to be decided by individual states, allowing them to remove or strictly limit access to surgical abortion as well as medication abortion. The regulations have reduced the number of operating clinics that provide these services and introduced increased volatility as clinics alter the mix of services they provide. Closures of clinics will send consumers to different clinics, increasing the level of concentration in other service markets, increase competition for skilled professionals to meet demand, but will also provide an opportunity for expansion."

However, regulations banning or restricting surgical and medication abortions have changed this dynamic, affecting where individuals choose to go for these services. Since clinics vary in the range of services they offer, some will fulfill the needs of these individuals, while others may not. According to the 2023 Impact Report from Planned Parenthood Mar Monte (PPMM), in the fiscal year 2023, a year following the Dobbs ruling, PPMM provided care to patients who were compelled to travel from 36 different states to access abortion services at their clinics."
