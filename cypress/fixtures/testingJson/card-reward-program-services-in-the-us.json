    "executive_summary": "Macroeconomic improvements and greater acceptance of reward programs have driven growth for card reward program services. Over the past five years, consumers' willingness to accrue higher levels of debt led to increased demand for operators' complementary services. In addition, consumers have maintained a taste for rewards program services, while both national and local retailers have increased their card-linked marketing efforts. Nonetheless, robust economic volatility during COVID-19, coupled with rising interest rates, have harmed consumers' ability to manage large amounts of credit card debt, causing revenue to shrink at a CAGR of 0.3% to an estimated $836.9 million through the end of 2023, with an estimated 1.6% boost in 2023 alone. The push to hike interest rates accelerated credit card interest rates, which also negatively influenced operators' profit. In 2023, profit, measured as earnings before interest and taxes, is expected to account for 17.5% of revenue.",
