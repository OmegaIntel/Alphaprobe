Revenue has depressed at a CAGR of 3.0% through the end of 2024 to an estimated $40.4 billion, including an expected 3.0% drop in 2024 alone. This downturn is partly because of volatility in steel and aluminum prices, driven by production halts in 2020 and ongoing post-pandemic supply chain issues, which have increased production costs across the industry.",
