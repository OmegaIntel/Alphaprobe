    "executive_summary": "Figures have been adjusted for inflation and are presented in 2022 currency. Over the five years to 2022, revenue for the Ambulance Manufacturing industry has increased. The industry has experienced relatively strong growth during the period, in part, due to shifting demographics. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), a reported 15.7% of total emergency department (ED) visits involve the use of an ambulance, with 35.2% of ED visits among adults aged 65 and older using an ambulance. The number of people aged and older has grown during the period, boding well for operators. Furthermore, the industry has experienced revenue growth in line with increasing healthcare spending and the number of people with private health insurance. This has led to increased revenue for hospitals and other ambulance service providers, increasing their propensity to purchase industry goods. As a result, industry revenue has slowly increased, rising at an annualized rate of 0.8% to $718.0 million over the five years to 2022.",

            "current_performance_point_description": "Industry operators complete ambulance vehicles produced on purchased chassis. Generally, hospitals and other various medical institutions purchase these finished industry products from operators to satisfy potential patients. In general, the structure of business for ambulance services has shifted in recent years. State budgetary issues, particularly among rural municipalities that may lack sufficient tax revenue to provide ambulance services, have spurred a movement toward private, for-profit ambulance providers. Many privately owned ambulance providers have been able to offer quicker response periods, and these companies' national operations enable them to cut costs, including expenditures related to securing reimbursements from Medicare and Medicaid and other private insurance providers. Private, for-profit ambulance providers have been able to outsource their billing process, thus enabling them to provide relatively low-cost services. As a result, these private operators flourished, leading to a strong surge in demand for assembled ambulances. As the industry's downstream market has been altered, demand for manufactured ambulances has grown."

            "current_performance_point_title": "Industry Structure",
            "current_performance_point_description": "As ambulance manufacturers have experienced fluctuations in demand from these downstream markets, operators have begun to seek out ways to benefit from economies of scale. Prior to the period, REV Group Inc. (REV), a specialty vehicle manufacturer, acquired three smaller ambulance producing brands. The acquisitions helped to establish REV as the dominant ambulance manufacturer and would signal a sustained trend of consolidation across the industry. To remain competitive with REV's enhanced economies of scale, Braun Industries Inc., the other major player in the industry, has also adopted an acquisition strategy. Overall, the number of industry enterprises has increased at an annualized rate of 1.1% to 19 companies over the five years to 2022."

Workers use electrically and hydraulically powered tools, and production lines also require large hydraulic lifts and other systems to correctly arrange vehicle components for final assembly. As facilities have continued to open, companies have increasingly hired new employees to keep up with strong downstream demand. Industry employment has increased at an annualized rate of 3.3% to 2,188 workers over the five years to 2022."

This is partially explained by appreciation of the US dollar during the period, which has hampered export growth. As the dollar appreciates relative to other currencies, domestic goods become more expensive abroad, and therefore, less desirable. Overall, the value of exports has fallen at an annualized rate of 5.6% to $44.9 million over the five years to 2022. Meanwhile, despite the appreciation of the US dollar, the value of industry imports has also declined due to a greater demand for domestically produced ambulances. The value of imports are has decreased at an annualized rate of 5.3% to $52.6 million over the five years to 2022. As the US dollar appreciates, domestic consumers have more purchasing power in markets abroad. Canada is expected to account for more than 99.0% of all imported ambulances in 2022."

While still increasing, the number of people with private health insurance and overall health expenditures are expected to stall. Furthermore, a deceleration in local and state government funding may hinder hospitals' abilities to purchase new ambulances. Nonetheless, demand for ambulatory services is not expected to fall significantly as enhanced regulatory standards and product innovations are expected to entice downstream operators to continue to modernize their fleets. As a result, industry revenue is expected to decrease at an annualized rate of just 0.3% to $708.9 million over the five years to 2027."

The number of adults aged 65 and older is anticipated to grow at an annualized rate of 2.8% over the five years to 2027 due to the aging baby boomer generation. As people age, they are more likely to require the use of emergency services, including ambulances. Therefore, more hospitals and private service providers are likely to purchase more emergency vehicles contributing to demand growth for the industry."

In 2017, Braun Industries Inc. developed and released its MasterTech Fleet Connect, an ambulance connectivity software that enables remote maintenance and troubleshooting. The system is likely to improve the longevity of ambulances and reduce maintenance problems. As this system gains popularity, other companies will likely need to develop their own monitoring systems. It is likely that competing companies, such as REV Group Inc., will implement similar technological advancements into their latest vehicle fleets, enabling them to sell these ambulances at higher price points. Furthermore, ambulances equipped with the latest technology that are likely to lessen transport time and generally maximize efficiency are expected to stoke demand from downstream markets."

Over the next five years, the trade-weighted index is expected to fall, indicating a depreciating US dollar. This depreciation is expected to benefit exporters of industry goods as industry products become relatively more affordable abroad. The value of exports is expected to grow at an annualized rate of 0.1% to $45.1 million over the five years to 2027. Meanwhile, import penetration of industry goods is expected to decline slightly as the dollar depreciates, since the buying power of the US dollar will decrease making imports relatively more expensive. Canada will likely continue to dominate as the source of industry imports, given its proximity and strong levels of government investment. Overall, the value of imports is expected to decrease an annualized 0.7% to $50.8 million over the five years to 2027."
