Blood donations decreased and led to shortages and procedures demanding industry products declined due to quarantine mandates and fear of hospitals. Organ donations remained steady, but supply-demand equilibrium was disturbed due to the increased number of patients waiting for transplants. With corporate blood donations remaining slow as remote work persists, but with school and college donations picking up, the industry grew at a CAGR of 1.7% through 2023 and is expected to reach $17.8 billion in 2024.",
