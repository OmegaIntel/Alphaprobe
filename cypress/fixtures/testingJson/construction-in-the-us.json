    "executive_summary": "The Construction sector ultimately grew over the five years through 2024, with recently high interest rates not fully eroding previous years' gains. Sector operators construct buildings and engineer projects across a wide range of industries and applications, so construction sector revenue tends to correlate with broader macroeconomic conditions. Prior to 2022, the sector benefited from low interest rates, providing an accommodative borrowing environment for both residential consumers and nonresidential clients. Rising interest rates have since stymied sector growth.",

            "current_performance_point_description": "The COVID-19 pandemic had a mixed effect on the construction sector, with overall industry revenue ultimately rising in 2020 and 2021. Lowered interest rates and a general trend of people spending more time in (and therefore spending more money on) their homes drove an increase in the value of residential construction during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic, driving construction sector revenue growth. The value of private nonresidential construction was particularly negatively impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic as demand for office space dropped as working from home became more common, reducing investment in nonresidential construction."

Rising interest rates have particularly negatively impacted residential construction, as the rising cost of mortgage loans has decreased spending on residential construction."

            "current_performance_point_description": "The supply chain issues that came in the wake of the pandemic increased the cost of construction materials, including lumber, steel and other materials. This dramatic inflation of construction materials was passed along to clients, contributing to growing revenue over the past five years. Supply chain issues increase uncertainty and lead times on projects, negatively impacting operators in the construction sector's ability to operate efficiently. High fuel costs and driver shortages threw a wrench into the efficient transportation of construction materials. Widespread worker shortages had a negative impact across the supply chain for construction materials."

High interest rates raise the cost of capital needed for construction. Interest rates are expected to ultimately fall from their current heights over the coming years, but will not likely reach pandemic lows. It remains questionable whether mortgage rates will immediately lower in response to falling interest rates, especially as demand for housing outpaces supply. With many homeowners having secured loans at historically low interest rates in recent years, demand for residential construction will be lower in coming years as individuals are reluctant to move and give up their current rates."

In particular, the bill will provide funding for roads and bridges, green power infrastructure, passenger and freight rail, water infrastructure and other projects. Passed in 2022, the Inflation Reduction Act will provide funding for construction projects meant to reduce the nation's greenhouse gas emissions over a period of ten years. The 2022 CHIPS and Science Act provides for funding for domestically produced semiconductors, which will benefit the construction sector in coming years. Already, the CHIPS Act and the IRA have contributed to a surge in US construction spending for manufacturing facilities that is set to continue in the near future. Long-standing federal, state and local housing assistance programs will continue to be a steady source of revenue for the construction sector."
