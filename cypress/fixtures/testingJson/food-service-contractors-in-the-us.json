    "executive_summary": "Food service contractors serve a diverse clientele, including hospitals, universities, ticketed venues and businesses, with demand and performance tied to that of their clients. COVID-19 forced the cancellation of most events, impacting food contractors and causing many companies to bow out of the industry. However, contractors offering 'essential' services to schools, universities and corrections facilities continued to operate amid lockdowns. A renewed desire to eat out stimulated the food contractors industry when the pandemic eased. Despite a significant drop in 2020 and a moderate drop in 2021, the food service contractors saw substantial and rewarding growth in 2022, a level not witnessed in a decade.",
