    "executive_summary": "Construction machinery lessors play a crucial role by leasing heavy construction and transportation equipment to support downstream construction markets. The advantages of renting are particularly beneficial for contractors as it alleviates them from bearing the burdens of depreciation and maintenance costs, ultimately contributing to increased revenue for lessors. The appeal of renting is heightened because many contractors lack adequate space to store machinery. While the pandemic caused slumps among commercial and industrial markets, low-interest rates spurred an uptick in residential projects, providing a cushion for lessors. As the pandemic waned, interest rates spiked as inflationary concerns crept up, weakening residential construction. Even so, this prompted industrial and commercial sectors to resume projects that were held off. Overall, revenue for ...",
