    "executive_summary": "Figures have been adjusted for inflation and are presented in 2024 currency. A rise in time spent on leisure activities is driving consumers toward recreational services like axe throwing centers. Axe throwing center providers are part of a larger industry group with more than one hundred indoor and outdoor entertainment, recreation, amusement, camp and club services. Consumer recreational expenditures declined and shifted to local outdoor recreation or in-home entertainment during the COVID-19 pandemic. But since the pandemic revenue has been growing as national popularity of axe throwing keeps growing.",
