Funding for the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP) has increased allowing for increased access to pediatric care, while a rising number of children aged nine and younger has further expanded the industry's market. While the number of births per year has been on the decline, immigration has kept the total number of children in the US from declining, keeping demand for pediatric care stable. As a result of these trends, over the five years to 2024, industry revenue is expected to grow at a CAGR of 2.4% to $18.3 billion, including an expected 0.4% increase in 2024.",

This trend is expected to continue over the coming years as rising utility and rent costs will make child rearing financially difficult for many young couples. With fewer births, the number of children in the US will decline, lowering demand for pediatric healthcare. However, immigration is expected to keep the number of children at a healthy level in the US, reducing volatility for pediatricians."
