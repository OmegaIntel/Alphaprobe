Demand for renovations, land clearing, sewer installations, retrofits and expansions has risen over the past few years as downstream manufacturers have sought to make operations more flexible, energy efficient and environmentally friendly. An unexpected increase in demand from a rapid economic recovery has increased the need to retrofit plants since existing production capabilities are insufficient. Interest rate hikes have continued to spur some growth in this segment, as performing additions and renovations is often less expensive than building new structures."

            "answer": "Contractors that enter into long-term supply contracts will exhibit lower purchase costs, less revenue volatility and increased profitability.

            "answer": "Most property industry purchases, developments and construction activities are financed by mortgages or bonds, which are related to the yield on 10-year Treasury bonds. While interest rates are overall low, rising short-term yields will increase rates on mortgage instruments since they are based on long-term, not overnight rates. Rising yields will translate to higher borrowing costs."

        },
        {
            "question": "Has your company had any difficulty securing future contracts in regard to a slowdown in capital expenditure?",
            "answer": "Private investment in manufacturing structures includes new work, additions, alterations, maintenance and repairs.

Capital expenditure has been depressed as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic."
