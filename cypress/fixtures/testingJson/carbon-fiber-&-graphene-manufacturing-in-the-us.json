    "executive_summary": "Figures have been adjusted for inflation and are presented in 2024 currency. Carbon fiber is a strong, extremely lightweight composite material that can be molded to take on a permanent shape. Carbon fiber has many useful properties which make it a go-to in a wide range of applications. These include corrosion resistance, low upkeep, excellent durability, high stability and a high level of design freedom. Demand for carbon fiber on an organic basis has grown significantly in recent years and is likely to continue growing robustly moving forward. Carbon Fiber and Graphene Manufacturing industry operators experienced declines in 2020 during the pandemic. Following these disruptions, a strong recovery in demand across market segments has bolstered industry growth. Revenue is forecast to rise at a CAGR of 1.9% to $3.2 billion through the end of 2024, with growth of 2.3% estimated for the current year. Carbon fiber is primarily used in aerospace applications due to its high cost compared with steel and aluminum, which discourages manufacturers from using it in more mainstream industrial applications. In addition, carbon fiber components are increasingly incorporated into consumer automobiles, particularly higher-end luxury models. Firms are continuously investing in research and development to improve the commercialization of carbon fiber and graphene. Currently, graphene is still an emerging technology, accounting for a negligible portion of industry revenue. However, several companies are racing to develop and patent graphene applications, which could potentially revolutionize the industry over the coming years, increasing profit. Moving forward, industry revenue is forecast to increase at a CAGR of 1.1% to $3.4 billion through the end of 2029. Downstream manufacturers will increase purchases of carbon fiber as production expands and demand for stronger yet lighter products rises. Exports are also anticipated to increase, boosting.",

This is attributed to the properties of carbon fiber such as high stiffness, high tensile strength, low weight, high chemical resistance, high-temperature tolerance, and low thermal expansion. Carbon fibers are extensively used to manufacture components of aircraft and defense equipment, thus driving growth in the carbon fiber manufacturing industry."
