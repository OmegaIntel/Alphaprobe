Since people couldn't leave their homes, consumer spending plunged, reducing revenue for retailers, restaurants, manufacturers and other sectors. The companies in sectors disrupted by the pandemic displayed tanking revenue and profit, so their investment in advertising declined massively, reducing revenue for Billboard and Outdoor Advertisers."

Surging household spending has caused corporate profit to soar throughout many industries.

The Federal Reserve has been raising interest rates in recent months to combat high inflation, pushing up the cost of borrowing.

Since building and maintaining billboards and other displays are extremely expensive, small companies can't survive when revenue falls dramatically. To save face, these players have either gone into bankruptcy or merged with major players, pushing up concentration."

Higher incomes will foster more consumer spending, increasing revenue for downstream industries (e.g., retailers, manufacturers). While many of these companies will use online advertising, some will opt for the industry's services, providing billboard and outdoor advertisers with new revenue streams.
