    "executive_summary": "Declines in construction activity have limited demand for the faucet manufacturing industry over the past five years to 2023. Demand for faucets primarily relies on the number of new houses built, residential remodeling activity and trends in the nonresidential construction market. Industry revenue has declined and has fluctuated with construction activity. Construction markets tend to be cyclical, typically experiencing years of decline following years of growth. In addition, due to the emergence of the pandemic in 2020, activity within the nonresidential sector eroded. Also, high-interest rates issued by the Federal Reserve hindered residential construction activity, hampering industry revenue.",

Similarly, the residential construction sector is a key downstream market for faucets since products are installed in bathrooms, kitchens and laundry rooms.
