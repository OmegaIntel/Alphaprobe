High economic uncertainty during the pandemic and consumers avoiding exposure to the virus caused revenue growth to weaken. However, high inflation during 2022 caused prosthetic sales to dip. Improving economic conditions have enabled revenue to recover over the following years, representing significant demand for prosthetic manufacturers. A strong US dollar and weak domestic performance enabled imported prosthetics to meet a larger portion of domestic demand, mainly driven by lower costs."

This population generally remains stable as a share of the entire population. Growth in the US population is one of the drivers of revenue growth. Another driver of growth is product innovation, as evolving technologies often boost demand for these products. Over the past five years, more companies have entered the industry to offer prostheses that combine artificial intelligence and other technology to improve the functionality of existing products."

Improving economic conditions can result in patients having higher disposable income. Having more resources makes patients more inclined to invest in prosthetics, giving them more mobility and comfort. The expected depreciation of the US dollar is forecast to support demand for domestic prosthetics by causing exports to grow and imports to account for a smaller share of domestic demand. However, these gains are likely to be minimal."
