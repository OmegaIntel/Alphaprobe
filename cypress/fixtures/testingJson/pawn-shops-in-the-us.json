    "executive_summary": "The Pawn Shops industry has performed poorly through the end of 2023. Prior to 2020, strong performance in the broader economy reduced demand for pawn loans from low-income consumers that experienced improvements in their financial positions. Consumers who fall below the poverty line represent the primary source of demand for pawn loans and when their number is reduced, pawn loan demand declines. While merchandise sales grew in line with rising consumers, the COVID-19 pandemic prompted large-scale fiscal programs by the federal government in 2020 and 2021, resulting in lower demand for pawn loans by low-income consumers who lost their jobs or experienced reduced incomes otherwise. Also, reducing consumer spending in 2020 reduced demand for merchandise sales. Industry revenue has been shrinking at an annualized rate of 0.3% over the past five years and is expected to total $3.6 billion in 2023 when revenue will sink an estimated 4.9%.",

Measures included enhanced unemployment benefits, one-time stimulus checks to households and the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP), which provided forgivable loans to small and medium businesses to cover payroll and other operating expenses.

In addition to providing loans, pawn shops buy goods directly from customers who want to sell off their expensive used goods. High purchasing costs are typical for an industry that retails goods because it is essential for stores to have a sufficient quantity and range of stock on hand.

            "question": "Has your company considered moving headquarters to a less expensive geographic area?",

            "question": "How do you expect proposed changes to legislation will affect your company?",

When consumers have easy access and are able to pursue long-term loans with large financial institutions, they will not go to pawnbrokers to purchase second-hand goods.

            "question": "How do your profit margins compare to those of your competitors?",
            "answer": "Profit margins are high for pawnbrokers due to the high interest rates they charge on loans. Brokers typically loan small sums to customers in exchange for collateral. Due to lower demand for pawn loans amid the coronavirus pandemic and government provision of liquidity to households, industry profit has declined."

            "answer": "Operators will benefit from controlling inventory by only purchasing items that will sell and leave room for items gained from customers' lost collateral. Demand for certain items amid the coronavirus pandemic, such as consumer electronics and guns, increased due to stay-at-home orders and social distancing measures. Demand for other items may increase now that social distancing measures are abating."

            "answer": "It is increasingly important for pawnbrokers to have the necessary licenses to conduct business. Licensed pawnbrokers need to provide further evidence that they are upholding regulatory standards. Industry operators also gravitate toward states that allow them to charge higher interest rates to clients, such as Texas."

            "answer": "While some consumers may pawn items with the intent to sell, many redeem their items. Consequently, consumers are less likely to pawn their items when they are uncertain about the economy and their ability to purchase items back. This factor may assist industry operators somewhat as the economy recovers from the coronavirus pandemic and consumers regain confidence in their ability to repay pawn loans."
