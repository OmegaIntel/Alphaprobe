While the decade-long trend of large multifunctional apparel companies integrating embellishment processes into their operations poses a threat to operators, stable underlying demand from commercial buyers in need of providing embroidered uniforms to an increasing number of employees initially kept operators' revenue steady. However, this core market, coupled with downstream buyers which include the administrative and hospitality sectors, endured a sharp fall in demand in 2020 due to COVID-19, significantly hampering core revenue channels and demand streams for operators' services.",
