    "executive_summary": "Over the past five years, the Hair Salons industry has benefited from rising consumer sentiment and per capita disposable income. These trends have also increased demand for ancillary services to standard haircuts like hair modification treatments (e.g. straightening procedures, perms and relaxing treatments), skincare services and others. Nonetheless, the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 led to the temporary closure of industry establishments and a significant decline in demand in 2020 as individuals had fewer reasons to get haircuts due to stay-at-home mandates and high unemployment. These economic trends caused revenue to decline at a CAGR of 1.5% to an estimated $52.2 billion over the past five years, while inching upward an anticipated 0.2% in 2023.",

Many companies and stylists leveraged online platforms like Instagram and Facebook as a cost-effective way to attract clientele. Many salons have also turned to mobile applications, like MyTime, to streamline the appointment booking process and provide a convenient way for clients to schedule appointments. Additionally, hair salons have been extending their product and service offerings to appeal to diversified demographics and niche markets. Nonetheless, profit declined during the five-year period, with the average profit margin reaching 5.0% of revenue in 2023."

        "Emphasis on strong per capita disposable income growth is crucial for the industry. If consumers lack fiscal flexibility in affording these discretionary services, demand for many hair services will decline.",
        "Diverse regulatory landscape fuels larger compliance costs for hair salons. Since most of the hair salons within the industry are small and localized, the wide variety of consumer and safety regulations enhances compliance costs.",
        "Consistent consumer demand for traditional haircuts fuels revenue. Despite offering increasing luxury services that focus on looks, standard haircuts remain the core contributor for hair salons.",
        "Activity among younger consumers is dependent on stable economic conditions. Since younger consumers lack large discretionary income, any large-scale economic volatility will dampen their propensity to consume more expensive salon services.",

        "The industry's fragmented nature leads to low market concentration. Hair salons succeed when they secure a notable stream of customers and can market their services to them.",
        "Industry profitability is dependent on stable economic conditions. If the economy performs poorly and consumer confidence drops, hair salons will suffer revenue losses as consumer demand will decline.",
