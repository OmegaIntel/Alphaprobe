    "executive_summary": "During the current period, concerns over the future of petroleum-based plastics supported the need for recyclable and sustainable bioplastics. Volatility in the world price of crude oil influenced major plastics producers to search for an alternative. Despite oil price volatility, bioplastics remain more expensive than petro-based products. Revenue has been falling at a CAGR of 1.7% through the end of 2024 to $677.8 million, including an expected jump of 0.5% in 2024 alone. Profit is also expected to slump to 3.9% of revenue in 2024, down from 7.6% in 2019.\n\nRising environmental awareness has encouraged the government and large companies to promote bioplastics, benefiting the industry. Also, the industry benefits from the local, state and federal government's push to transition to more environmentally friendly products. The US government instituted a bio-preferred program, which prefers bio-based materials over petroleum-based products in government purchase decisions. In addition, companies have continued to adopt bioplastics to reach sustainability targets and promote their efforts to go green. This has been primarily seen in packaging and consumer goods product manufacturers. The industry is still in its early stages, leading to high expenditure on research and development.",

Petroleum-based plastics manufacturers pass costs on to customers, significantly affecting the price of traditional plastic goods. Still, this volatility highlights the need for bioplastic alternatives, as price points are more reliable for downstream consumers."
