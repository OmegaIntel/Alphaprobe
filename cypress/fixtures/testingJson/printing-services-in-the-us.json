    "executive_summary": "Printing services have declined markedly over the past few years as demand for print media has fallen. Demand for printing services is highly correlated with the performance of the Printing industry (IBISWorld report 32311) and demand for book, newspaper and magazine publishing, both of which have experienced similar declines. This contraction occurred because of the fast-growing popularity of online media, causing many companies to reduce print advertising expenditures. These factors were exacerbated by the outbreak of COVID-19 in 2020. Overall, revenue for printing service providers is expected to drop at a CAGR of 4.1% during the current period, reaching $2.8 billion in 2024. This includes a 8.3% decline in revenue in that year.",
