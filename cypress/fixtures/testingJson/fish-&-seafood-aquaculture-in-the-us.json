    "executive_summary": "Figures have been adjusted for inflation and are presented in 2024 currency. Revenue for the fish and seafood aquaculture industry has expanded over the past five years, growing at a CAGR of 0.4% to $2.4 billion over the five years to 2024, despite stagnating in 2024. This growth has been largely fueled by changing consumer behaviors, with more individuals exploring new food options and making healthier dietary choices. The industry saw its most robust growth at the beginning of this period, as consumers were eager to embrace these new trends. However, this growth has been tempered in recent years due to the impacts of inflation and tighter consumer budgets. While the industry has faced challenges, it has also seen some notable successes. One area where this is evident is in the realm of profit. Despite facing headwinds such as increased competition from overseas and the rising costs of inputs, the industry has managed to maintain profitability. This can be attributed to the continued demand for seafood products and the industry's ability to adapt and innovate in response to changing market conditions. However, the pressure from these challenges has led to a decrease in profitability, underscoring the need for the industry to continue evolving and finding new ways to drive growth. Looking ahead to the next five years, several trends are expected to shape the future of the fish and seafood aquaculture industry. As consumer demand for seafood continues to grow, the industry is expected to see a resurgence in growth. This will likely be fueled by a combination of factors, including a decline in imports, which will give domestic producers more power to set prices and a decrease in feed costs. Additionally, the depreciation of the US dollar is expected to boost exports, making domestic products more competitive in the global market. These trends, coupled with the continued demand for seafood, suggest a promising future for the industry. Industry revenue is forecast to rise at a CAGR of 1.2% to $2.5 billion over the next five years.",
