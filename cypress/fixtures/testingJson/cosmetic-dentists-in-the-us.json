    "executive_summary": "The cosmetic dentistry industry navigated substantial demand changes and cost fluctuations during the pandemic. Many dental offices temporarily shut down, facing declines in demand resulting from stay-at-home guidelines and the postponement of nonessential procedures. Coupled with a high unemployment rate, these conditions led to financial challenges for the industry, including falling revenues and increasing purchase and wage costs, leading to fluctuating profit. However, once the pandemic subsided, consumer demand returned and profit returned to pre-pandemic levels.",

Facing high unemployment rates, consumers prioritized saving and spending on essentials, postponing non-essential cosmetic procedures. This change in consumer behavior led to decreased revenue and increased costs for dental practices, resulting in profit declines and unpredictable revenue streams."

Consumers spent more time watching themselves on screen through remote schooling and work, highlighting any aesthetic insecurities. Veneers, once reserved for older adults who could commit to the upkeep, have gained popularity among younger consumers. The aging older adult population has brought consumers to cosmetic dental offices. Aging leads to many dental challenges. With appearance and health concerns, revenue from older adults makes up a third of the average practice revenue."

These solutions sell themselves on ease of use, at-home application and affordability. Also, many of these solutions have increased the quality of outcomes. Dental practice organizations are strategically evolving, targeting competitiveness in cosmetic dentistry by offering cosmetic treatments, adopting advanced technologies, offering diverse treatment options and implementing cost-sharing models."

Some dental groups use robotic devices to place implants and 3D printing technology has revolutionized lab procedures, making the production process more streamlined and efficient."
