    "executive_summary": "The values of new residential and nonresidential construction directly contribute to demolition and wrecking demand. Demand for demolition and wrecking services has risen because of broad-based economic growth, a strong housing market and more significant construction activity. Still, due to COVID-19, all nonessential construction activity decreased in the first two quarters of 2020, which caused industry revenue to decline. Poor macroeconomic conditions in 2023 also constrained revenue growth. Still, industry-wide revenue has increased at a CAGR of 2.0% to $9.7 billion through the end of 2024, including an expected 3.3% increase in 2024.",
