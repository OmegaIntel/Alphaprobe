    "executive_summary": "The Gear and Speed Changer Manufacturing industry makes power transmission equipment and gears used in the production processes of different downstream manufacturers. End users, which include food and beverage processors, paper manufacturers, plastic manufacturers and construction contractors, require power transmission equipment and gears to outfit their equipment. Through 2023, the pandemic created high economic uncertainty, suppressing consumer spending. Overall economic activity declined, slowing industrial production and weakening demand for the industry's products. Overall, revenue will stagnate to an estimated $4.2 billion through 2023.",

The Paper Mills industry (IBISWorld report 32212) buys high-speed industrial drivers to manufacture paper products, including printing, writing, newsprint, packaging and household papers. As consumers have switched to online communication, cutting out paper, this market has crashed, forcing gear and speed changer manufacturers to shift production to cater to other industries."

As the value of the US dollar grows relative to other currencies, US goods and services become less affordable and desirable for foreign markets. Notably, import penetration accounts for more than 70.0% of domestic demand. Imports from low-wage countries, like China, outcompete domestic products, while German and Japanese products can match the quality of domestic manufacturers."

Increasing volatility in steel and aluminum prices has created uncertainty, especially as supply chains contracted following the pandemic. For example, world steel prices skyrocketed more than 110.0% in 2021. Many manufacturers could pass on rising costs to buyers, generating massive revenue increases in 2021 and 2022. Even so, these costs have slammed profit, causing it to plummet more than 41.0% in 2021 alone."
