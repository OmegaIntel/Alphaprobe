    "executive_summary": "The Dental Clinical Instrument Manufacturing industry has declined slightly over the past five years despite stable demand for routine dental procedures and the growing number of Americans over the age of 65. Recent disruptions to the international market for US-made dental instruments have led to a significant decline in the value of industry exports over the five years to 2023. In addition, technological advancements have enabled manufacturers to produce dental instruments at a lower cost, bringing down industry prices and ultimately revenue. Over the past five years, revenue has slumped at a CAGR of 0.3% to $5.3 billion, including an expected 1.3% decline in 2023. Profit is expected to climb to 8.1% of revenue in 2023 from 7.7% in 2018.",

With higher unemployment, many people lost their employer-sponsored health insurance. The pandemic made it difficult for dentists and orthodontists to perform dental procedures safely, reducing downstream demand in 2020."

            "current_performance_point_title": "Increased Disposable Income and Manufacturers Reducing Operating Costs Boosted Profit",
            "current_performance_point_description": "The aging US population has limited the declining demand experienced by the industry because people over the age of 65 typically have higher levels of disposable income and health insurance coverage and are also more likely to require routine dental services. Over the past five years, the number of adults aged 65 and older has increased. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA) freed up more consumer disposable income to be used on dental procedures. A significant share of this out-of-pocket cash was spent on preventative procedures. Over the past five years, demand from cosmetic dentists declined limiting elective and cosmetic procedures. Many of the products used in these procedures are advanced and costly to produce, so many manufacturers invested in research and development to find ways to reduce operating costs, ultimately boosting profit."

            "future_outlook_point_description": "Several favorable demographic trends among US consumers will help increase demand for newly manufactured dental clinical instruments. Necessary trips to the dentist from the aging US population will limit revenue declines over the next five years. In addition, the industry will encounter increased demand from the generally improving economic climate and its effect on personal disposable income, as well as the number of people that can afford private health insurance. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act's (PPACA) mandated extension of covered oral care to all pediatric patients is expected to decrease the number of children without dental insurance."

This trend is expected to continue over the next five years and will help limit revenue declines. High-value, high-profit clinical instruments used in specialized dental procedures such as preventative dental care or cosmetic dentistry will boost industry-wide profit. Developing advanced and specialized equipment is expected to support demand for US-made products in export markets. However, overseas competition will continue to keep exports low, despite the projected depreciation of the US dollar, making US goods relatively less expensive."

Increased production and automation is expected to reduce reliance on low-skilled production line workers. The relative importance of product development engineers and designers will continue to expand over the next five years. Competition among the industry's largest manufacturers will likely continue to result in acquisition activity, with many of these small companies being acquired for their innovative technologies or geographic market share."
