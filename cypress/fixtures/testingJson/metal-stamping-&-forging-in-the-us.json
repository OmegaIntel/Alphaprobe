        },
        {
            "question": "How have imports from low-wage countries like China and Mexico impacted your operations?",
            "answer": "Since China has much lower wage costs, operators in the country are able to produce their products at a lower cost point than domestic operators. China also maintains massive steel production pipelines, allowing for tighter vertical integration. To remain competitive, domestic operators must lower their prices to entice downstream markets, thus diminishing their returns. Alternatively, domestic operators can increase quality, market effectively, or go after government contracts, which often shun international competition."
        },
        {
            "question": "How has your company sought to lessen commodity price risk?",
            "answer": "The world price of steel, nonferrous metals and other metal inputs has been wildly volatile. Operators must be able to sell products at competitive prices to remain relevant, placing downward pressure on revenue and profit. Fixed-price deals with suppliers are becoming increasingly common to reduce risk and overall costs."

            "question": "How is your company leveraging new technology?",
            "answer": "Influenced by climbing electrical rates and high natural gas prices, manufacturers are increasingly adopting new technologies that provide greater efficiencies in the use of energy. Companies with enough liquidity may want to consider implementing energy-saving technology now, as regulations restricting industrial burning of fossil fuels are likely to be implemented in the next decade."
        },
        {
            "question": "Have you been able to reduce wage costs through automation over the past five years?",
            "answer": "Some operators have invested in equipment that increases automation, leading industry wages to decline marginally during the period. Due to high labor costs, many industrial operators are investing in robotics, sensors and other systems to decrease labor reliance. After the global chip shortage subsides, prices for these systems are anticipated to fall."
        },
        {
            "question": "How does your company stay ahead of regulations, such as energy-efficiency standards and tariffs?",
            "answer": "Most companies have developed extensive environmental, health and safety policies and procedures that include the proper handling, storage and disposal of hazardous materials. Sending employees to attend in-person or virtual trade shows will help keep your company current and multiply lobbying power for industry-wide."
        },
        {
            "question": "How have international tariffs impacted your ability to import and export products?",
            "answer": "International levies typically impede free trade and increase the cost of doing business. Operators that produce goods which are price elastic and can effectively pass on these expenses will earn consistently greater profit. If these tariffs affect your business significantly, you may want to try inducing demand or supply in non-traditional regions to save on costs in the long term."

        {
            "question": "How do your company's profit margins compare to your main competitors'?",
            "answer": "There is a large variation in the average profit margin for the industry and the larger players. Larger operators have been able to consistently post operating margin in the double-digits. Studying competitors' public documents, including 10-Ks and Annual Reports may give insights into their future projects and differentiating strategies."
        },
        {
            "question": "How has input price volatility affected profit margin?",
            "answer": "The fluctuation in the price of key inputs causes smaller operators to have a difficult time competitively pricing their products, as they are unable to secure steady price points from suppliers. Smaller operators may consider networking together to aggregate key inputs and negotiate more favorable terms with metal suppliers."
        },
        {
            "question": "Are you able to leverage economies of scale? What is your budget for expanding operations?",
            "answer": "A key success factor for industry operators is their ability to increase the scale of business production and reduce costs. Businesses that can efficiently scale production will generally prosper, so long as sufficient demand for its products exists. Alternatively, specialization in high-markup custom products is a path to profitability taken by many smaller operators. While companies using each method have prospered, mixing high-volume and low-volume manufacturing will likely cause management challenges."

        {
            "question": "How do you maintain product quality? How much of your revenue is derived from the aerospace and defense industries?",
            "answer": "All suppliers that supply the aerospace and defense industries are required to meet numerous quality standards to qualify as a preferred and long-term supplier to the original equipment manufacturer (OEM). While the regulations associated with producing these products are generally more stringent, companies that manufacture high-value metal goods tend to earn greater profit. Demonstrating high product quality will also protect your markets from choosing international products instead, which typically have lower quality standards."
        },
        {
            "question": "Do you have contacts with key distributors and end-users? How does your company go about establishing new contracts?",
            "answer": "Consolidation among downstream markets means that upstream supplies may be rewarded with long-term, sole-source contracts. Try forming multi-year, fixed-price contracts with key buyers and sellers, especially in the volatile metals markets."
        },
        {
            "question": "How have volatile steel prices affected your company's revenue and profit? Are you able to pass on steel costs to downstream consumers?",
            "answer": "High steel prices raise input purchase costs, but also boost the value of end-product inventory. Conversely, inventory is devalued when prices drop, hurting selling prices and revenue. Rising steel prices are favorable to this industry's performance because they indicate growing demand."
        },
        {
            "question": "How much of your business depends on aviation markets? Are you considering diversification to protect against future air transport market crashes?",
            "answer": "When considering future corporate purchases, those that diversify end-markets into more stable military contracts (such as ordnance) or alternative markets may increase long-term revenue stability."
        },
        {
            "question": "Do you monitor changes in the trade index? How do you take advantage of increased competition from abroad? Does your company market internationally?",
            "answer": "The trade-weighted index (TWI) measures the power of the United States dollar to purchase more goods than currencies of other nations. When the index increases, the dollar is getting more powerful, leading to pressure to import cheap inputs from abroad. Similarly, a decrease in the index incentivizes national production and exports. Companies must monitor all tariffs and currency valuations of import and export destination countries. Consider diversification into nations with weaker TWIs for inputs (metals) and stronger TWIs for end-markets."
