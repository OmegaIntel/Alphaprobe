Battery producers have benefited greatly from the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law as the act allocates significant funds toward clean energy infrastructure and EV charging stations across the country, which rely heavily on lithium batteries. Growth stagnated during the height of the pandemic amid plummeting consumer confidence and spending. Even so, the growing prevalence of EVs supported manufacturers, contributing to a stellar recovery. Producers have contended with volatile lithium prices, which have driven industry performance and displayed the weakening demand from the EV sector. These trends caused revenue to contract at an estimated CAGR of 0.5% to $1.9 billion through the end of 2024, despite a 3.8% gain that year alone, as manufacturers power through high interest rates and weak consumer confidence.",
