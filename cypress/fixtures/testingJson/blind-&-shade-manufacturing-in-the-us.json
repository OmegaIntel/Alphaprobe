    "executive_summary": "Blind and shade manufacturers have faced significant volatility in recent years, mainly driven by the fluctuating health of the construction sector. The 2020 pandemic initially resulted in substantial losses in the nonresidential real estate markets, which can be attributed to stay-at-home orders and work-from-home capabilities, while the residential market boomed amid low interest rates and growing disposable income. However, increasing inflationary pressure and interest rate hikes led to growing economic uncertainty, harming demand from the residential sector as many existing homeowners postponed or canceled the upgrade of blinds and shades. Although the nonresidential industry has begun to grow, these gains have been unable to mitigate the losses from the residential sector. These trends caused revenue to fall at an estimated CAGR of 1.8% to $2.4 billion through 2024, including a 1.5% jump during that year alone.",

            "current_performance_point_description": "- Uncertain economic conditions in recent years have encouraged consumers to conserve money and postpone replacing their blinds and shades. - Favorable economic conditions during the early stages of the pandemic enabled demand for blinds and shades to rise as consumers took on more home improvement projects and purchased more homes. - Elevated inflation and growing economic uncertainty led to rapid declines in the residential sector, which resulted in sharp revenue losses when combined with a weak nonresidential market. - Interest rates went from nearly zero percent to more than 5.0% as the Federal Reserve navigated the pandemic and the consequent spike in inflation. These changes have directly impacted the construction sector, resulting in significant revenue volatility."

            "current_performance_point_title": "Operators Have Still Contended With Several Long-Term Threats",
            "current_performance_point_description": "Foreign producers are increasingly threatening domestic manufacturers. Imported blinds and shades account for close to 45.0% of domestic demand, causing the domestic market to shrink and harming US producers. Lower operating costs overseas, including lower wage requirements and environmental regulations, enable foreign producers to offer lower prices. As a result, sales in the business have been somewhat hampered by overseas competition. The recent appreciation of the dollar has enabled international producers to appeal to an increasingly price-conscious market. A strong US dollar makes imported products comparatively more affordable than domestically produced ones, harming sales. Another problem for domestic manufacturers is the fluctuating cost of raw materials. Plastic, wood and aluminum prices for window and blind input materials have grown drastically in recent years."

            "current_performance_point_description": "Manufacturers have been forced to implement a number of cost-cutting strategies to address the challenges posed by import competition and fluctuating input costs. Many companies have tried to cut operational costs by merging businesses and eliminating locations that were not profitable or failing to compete with low-priced imports. To become more competitive, manufacturers have also opted for mergers and acquisitions. Many large producers have bought smaller brands to take advantage of economies of scale, which allows them to lower their cost of production per unit and increase profits while raising wages. Many manufacturers have also opted to move operations overseas to countries with lower operating costs to become more profitable. This trend has caused the industry to shrink."

            "future_outlook_point_description": "The ongoing economic recovery is likely to benefit blind and shade manufacturers. Weakening inflation and the possibility of interest rate declines create opportunities for the construction sector to recover by increasing consumers' financial capabilities. Residential construction recovery is forecast to drive blind and shade sales. Since many residential construction projects take longer to complete and window coverings are bought after residences are finished, revenue gains will likely occur over the coming years. The lengthy lead times involved with commercial structures cause these projects to frequently lag behind residential construction by one to two years. As a result, current gains from the nonresidential sector will reflect over the coming years, enabling revenue to grow faster."

It is anticipated that imports will continue to account for a sizable portion of domestic demand, restraining industry expansion. The expected depreciation of the US dollar over the coming years is forecast to boost demand for domestically produced blinds and shades, as a weaker dollar makes them comparatively more affordable than imported products. Although the dollar's depreciation is likely to weaken the share of domestic demand satisfied by imports, it will not have a significant impact, mainly because of the drastically lower operating costs foreign manufacturers benefit from."

This standard mandates that most window covering products sold in the US be cordless or have difficult-to-reach or short cords. New product development and ensuring compliance with new requirements will likely disrupt operations, driving operating costs higher as they adjust their manufacturing methods and preventing profit from growing significantly. Similarly, continuous volatility in the price of inputs, such as synthetic fiber and plastic materials, will make it challenging for manufacturers to control operating expenses, take advantage of their purchasing power and safeguard their profit."

As consumption bounced back in 2021, the price of many popular inputs, such as plastic and steel, jumped, harming manufacturers.

Blinds are widely used in commercial buildings and are supplied in large quantities due to agreements with contractors, designers and architects. As a result, one of the biggest consumers of Venetian blinds is the commercial construction sector.

            "answer": "Blind and shade manufacturers offer a range of products, including window blinds, shades and other fixtures made from a diverse selection of materials. Offering a range of products enables brand loyalty as homes and businesses seek to obtain all of their window coverings from one company. Operators that manufacture a variety of product types tend to be better insulated from economic downturns."
        },
        {
            "question": "Are your company's sales heavily dependent on the health of the US economy?",
            "answer": "The health of the US economy is important for this industry, which relies on high levels of consumer spending and construction activity. Economic growth drives demand for blinds and shades because as homes are newly built or remodeled, they will require new window coverings. In 2020, industry operators were negatively affected due to lower construction activity amid the coronavirus pandemic, particularly within the private non-residential sector."
        },
        {
            "question": "Is your company investing heavily in R&D to meet changing consumer preferences?",
            "answer": "R&D investment has been crucial for blind and shade manufacturers to stay on top of changing trends in new products and efficiency improvements. Modern window coverings with value-added features are more expensive to produce, increasing the amount manufacturers must outlay on R&D. Manufacturers also invest heavily on R&D relating to the production process, as production efficiencies give operators room to lower prices."
        },
        {
            "question": "Has your company been exposed to volatile input prices over the years?",
            "answer": "The prices of both sawmill lumber and plastic materials and resins have been volatile over the past five years. Amid the coronavirus pandemic, supply chain volatility has increased for industry operators. Volatile input prices can threaten profitability if manufacturers are unable to negotiate steady contracts with suppliers."

        {
            "question": "How does your company invest in technology, such as solar shades, to establish a competitive edge over your competitors?",
            "answer": "Some companies have introduced solar shades, which allow shades to trap air and insulate rooms from heat and cold. Some solar shades (such as Hunter Douglas' Honeycomb collection) are eligible for a federal tax credit due to their energy saving qualities, increasing their appeal to consumers."
        },
        {
            "question": "How is your company leveraging new technology, such as online order and tracking tools, in its operations?",
            "answer": "Putting tools on company websites permits clients to track the status of orders themselves, reducing customer service costs for manufacturers. Online ordering also makes it easier for downstream markets, such as wholesalers, to make purchases. With the COVID-19 pandemic creating volatility throughout global supply chains that disrupted standard operations, the use of technology can help streamline operations in terms of efficiency and limit the impact of supply chain disruptions."

        {
            "question": "Do you work with trade associations or other interest groups to advance your company's interests?",
            "answer": "Manufacturers receive assistance through associations such as the Window Coverings Association of America and the Window Coverings Manufacturers Association. These associations conduct industry trade shows, list current industry trends, and provide a network to exchange information and ideas."

        {
            "question": "Is your company adequately prepared to adjust to changing regulations in blind and shade cords?",
            "answer": "The US Consumer Product Safety Commission has worked with blind and shade manufacturers to make child-safe window coverings cords. As a result of growing lobbying efforts from parents concerned with window cord safety, new regulations for window covering cords were implemented in 2018. Generally, however, the industry is not highly regulated."
        },
        {
            "question": "What is your company doing to improve profit margins?",
            "answer": "Many large industry manufacturers, such as Springs Window Fashions, have started outsourcing their window coverings manufacturing to China and Mexico. Additionally, operating costs can be reduced by closing unprofitable facilities that are unable to compete with low-priced imports. Industry operators have struggled to maintain their profitability in the face of increasingly stiff import competition from foreign producers. Moreover, in 2020, industry profit took a hit due to lower downstream demand amid the COVID-19 pandemic, with the outlook for industry profit looking stagnant as a result of this demand effect."
        },
        {
            "question": "What has been the typical industry profit margin in recent years?",
            "answer": "Industry profit, measured as earnings before interest and taxes, accounted for 4.2% of revenue in 2022. Moving forward, the industry's profitability is expected to stagnate amid uncertain macroeconomic conditions, even as the economy recovers following the COVID-19 pandemic. Many large companies have acquired smaller brands to leverage economies of scale, achieving lower per-unit production costs and boosting profit margins."
