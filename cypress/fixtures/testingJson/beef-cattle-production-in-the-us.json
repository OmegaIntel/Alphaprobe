    "executive_summary": "Figures have been adjusted for inflation and are presented in 2024 currency. In the current period, fluctuating feed prices and production inefficiencies, exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic, have caused volatility in the price of red meat. In 2021 alone, the price of red meat jumped 21.1% as drought conditions lowered herd numbers and increased the price of feed. While red meat prices are expected to begin falling back toward pre-pandemic levels, the overall surge has resulted in revenue growing at a CAGR of 4.2% to $97.9 billion through the end of 2024. However, per capita beef consumption declines, and falling red meat prices have led to revenue dropping an estimated 3.7% in 2024. Industry profit has grown from 4.2% in 2018 to 5.3% in 2024 as feed prices begin to stabilize, putting less pressure on ranchers and feedlots.",
