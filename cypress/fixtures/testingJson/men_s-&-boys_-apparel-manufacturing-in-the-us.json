        {
            "question": "Does your company specialize in a niche or do you produce a diversified range of products?",
            "answer": "In response to intense price-based import competition, companies within the industry narrowed their product mix and specialized in higher value-added products to justify higher selling prices. Nonetheless, as the economy took a downturn in 2020, having a diversified roster of products has been key to success during the COVID-19 pandemic, as pricier items have been less in demand due to reduced consumer confidence."
        },
        {
            "question": "Have your company's sales been heavily affected by the health of the US economy in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic?",
            "answer": "Macroeconomic conditions, such as consumer confidence and unemployment, heavily influence demand for industry products, as they are key determinants in consumers' propensity to make discretionary purchases on premium industry products. As these metrics plummeted in response to COVID-19, it hastened industry declines."
        },
        {
            "question": "Have you looked into setting up manufacturing facilities in states or countries with less-restrictive working conditions established post-COVID-19?",
            "answer": "As states now have varying regulations regarding work safety and what facilities can be open, establishing operations elsewhere in response to idling facilities in more-regulated regions may be key to success in the wake of the pandemic."
        },
        {
            "question": "Has your company been exposed to volatile input prices due to the pandemic?",
            "answer": "Cotton is a key input in many apparel-manufacturing processes, so fluctuations in the price of cotton can have a significant impact on profit margins. Plummeting prices and interruptions in the supply chain due to the effects of COVID-19 (coronavirus) has exacerbated revenue declines while generally harming profit levels."
        },
        {
            "question": "Have you been able to reduce reliance on labor through automation during the pandemic?",
            "answer": "Industry processes, like cutting and sewing, require precise manual labor and many activities are difficult to automate because clothing styles vary each season and consumer preferences are constantly changing. Nonetheless, as employment fell due to the pandemic, those with the most sophisticated automated processes have been able to the most successful."
        },
        {
            "question": "Is your company investing in technology to establish a competitive edge?",
            "answer": "Due to high price-based competition, companies are shifting production toward high-value apparel. The detailed features that add value to these more expensive products are often hand-made, and thus are more labor-intensive than technology intensive."
        },
        {
            "question": "Do you work with trade associations or other interest groups to advance your company's interests?",
            "answer": "The American Apparel and Footwear Association (AAFA) aims to promote and enhance its members' competitiveness, productivity and profitability in the global market by minimizing regulatory, political and trade restraints."
        },
        {
            "question": "How have international travel restrictions to limit the spread of COVID-19 affected your revenue?",
            "answer": "US legislation has limited travel to certain regions, and other countries have put similar processes in place. However, many major import generators have been able to recover quicker from the pandemic due to more-stringent measures put in place, boosting capacity abroad and affecting trade dynamics."
        },
        {
            "question": "How has your company's profit and growth compared to your main competitors' during the pandemic period?",
            "answer": "Given the presence of competitively priced imports in the domestic market, companies face high pressure from downstream buyers to lower selling prices. Furthermore, like most clothing industries, companies compete based largely on price, and diminishing consumer sentiment due to COVID-19 has spurred many losses as companies compete for this reduced demand."
        },
        {
            "question": "How often does your company purchase new equipment?",
            "answer": "Expenditure on wages in this industry accounts for a much larger portion of revenue than expenditure on capital. However, investment in infrastructure has been a means of avoiding steeper declines during the COVID-19 pandemic."
        },
        {
            "question": "Which niches, if any, do you cater to? How can you diversify your product mix to remain successful despite reduced spending due to the effects of the COVID-19 (coronavirus pandemic)?",
            "answer": "The ability to offer niche products, such as private-label and branded clothing, allows industry participants to compete against other establishments more effectively. However, recent trends have favored more utilitarian and price-conscious products, rendering those that offers value or discount products have been able to better maintain demand during the pandemic."
        },
        {
            "question": "Do you have a reputation for good quality service? Do you manufacture any branded products?",
            "answer": "Consumer loyalty to established brands can help a company thrive in this competitive industry, and brand-name companies have been more successful than smaller-name operators during the pandemic, as they need to spend less on marketing to capture limited consumer demand."
        },
        {
            "question": "Has your company developed export markets? If so, is there capacity to increase export volumes as the value of the dollar depreciates in 2021 after COVID-19 lows?",
            "answer": "Manufacturers that can establish export markets insulate themselves from the more dramatic macroeconomic changes happening domestically in response to the COVID-19 pandemic."
        },
        {
            "question": "How have low-cost imports affected your company's sales? Have you experienced any change in demand as imports became scarcer in 2020?",
            "answer": "While import penetration has intensified the competitive pressures experienced by domestic manufacturers, given supply-chain interruptions due to the COVID-19, some consumers have chosen to buy domestically."
        },
        {
            "question": "How does your company maintain relationships with physical retailers? What other markets can you explore as this one dwindles due to stay-at-home orders?",
            "answer": "Retailer demand for clothing drives the output of manufacturing operators, and has been declining for years. Due to COVID-19, retail traffic is down even further, rendering a diversification of customers crucial for success in 2020 and 2021."
        },
        {
            "question": "Do you track consumer spending? How do you plan to capture rising consumer spending despite poor macroeconomic conditions caused by COVID-19?",
            "answer": "Consumer spending growth stimulates apparel sales, boosting industry revenue. While spending is anticipated to expand somewhat, new clothing has been less of a necessity as more people stay at home, meaning those with price-diverse product lines have been more successful."
