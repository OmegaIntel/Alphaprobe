    "executive_summary": "Changing consumer trends and economic growth have translated into pressured demand for cereal producers. Low-carb diets have grown increasingly popular, limiting the number of consumers buying cereal, while other health-conscious consumers are only interested in cereals made with nutritious ingredients. Companies have also struggled as consumers leverage rebounding disposable incomes, indulging in premium breakfast foods. Consumer preferences have shifted toward convenient and portable foods as free time becomes more limited, hampering cereal demand. Still, cereal popularity has remained relatively steady in recent years. Overall, revenue has inched downward at a CAGR of 1.2% to $11.8 billion through the current period, including a 0.8% drop in 2024 alone.",
