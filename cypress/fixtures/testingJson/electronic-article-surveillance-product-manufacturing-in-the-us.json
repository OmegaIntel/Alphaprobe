    "executive_summary": "Demand for electronic article surveillance (EAS) products has endured losses over recent years. The pandemic significantly impacted the retail sector, the largest market for these products. Stay-at-home orders and rising demand for online retailers discouraged consumers from shopping in brick-and-mortar stores, a trend that remained prominent as the economy reopened. Similarly, a falling crime rate has discouraged retailers from implementing and updating their security systems, as stores feel like theft becomes less likely. As a result, revenue has been falling at an estimated CAGR of 0.2% to $669.0 million over the past five years, including a 0.6% decline in 2023 alone.",

Strong preferences favoring online retailers have led to a weakening need for surveillance products, as traditional brick-and-mortar stores have a higher need for these products. The 2020 pandemic enhanced this trend, as most nonessential traditional retailers were required to pause operations to prevent the spread of the virus. The lack of need for EAS products in online sales due to the absence of physical shoplifting threats has negatively affected the performance and revenue of the EAS industry."

The crime rate has been continuously falling over recent years. The shift toward online retail over traditional brick-and-mortar stores also contributes to reduced shoplifting and thus decreased demand for EAS products. Despite these changes, shoplifting and employee theft continue to be significant concerns for retailers, sustaining some level of demand for EAS systems."

Significant supply chain disruptions over recent years led to a shortage and caused semiconductor prices to rise for the first time in decades. Wages as a share of revenue have expanded over recent years as manufacturers allocate more resources toward research and development capabilities, as these require highly skilled workers. Despite these challenges, large companies maintain higher profits as they leverage vertical integration to reduce production costs."

When consumers feel confident about the future of the economy, they are more likely to boost spending on new clothing and other nonessential items. A pickup in sales is estimated to boost demand for electronic article surveillance (EAS) systems as retailers aim to diminish losses. Although this trend is expected to boost discretionary purchases, the growing online preference is expected to harm revenue growth. Manufacturers will likely seek to add value to their products through the incorporation of enhanced functionality, such as inventory data collection, enabling the manufacturing sector to generate higher revenue."

However, an aging population and an improving economy will likely continue to reduce the crime rate over the coming years. The crime rate is expected to decline. As crime becomes less of a threat, retailers will not likely be as pressured to implement or expand their EAS systems, weakening EAS product sales. Improving economic conditions at the global level is expected to lead to the depreciation of the US dollar, making domestically produced products more attractive for both the US and global markets. A weaker dollar is likely to cause imports to slow down while exports gain traction globally, although imports will remain competitive due to their lower production costs."
