Demand is uniquely separate from the broader economic climate, in which revenue growth is primarily influenced by crime and incarceration rates. Public opinion and its effect on government policy regarding the privatization of prisons directly affects demand and participation. Revenue fell at a CAGR of 3.2% to an estimated $8.0 billion, including an estimated 6.0% decline in 2024 as profit reached an estimated 9.7%.",
