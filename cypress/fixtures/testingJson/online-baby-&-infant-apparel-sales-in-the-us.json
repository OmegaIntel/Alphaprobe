    "executive_summary": "Over the five years to 2023, revenue for the Online Baby and Infant Apparel Sales industry increased significantly, aided by the e-commerce sector capturing significant market share from brick-and-mortar apparel stores as more consumers felt more comfortable shopping online. Additionally, strengthening economic conditions for much of the period, including rising consumer confidence and disposable income, continue to boost demand for industry products. However, the number of births has decreased during the period, which in turn has pushed down the number of infants and toddlers. Even so, the economic climate and strong growth in e-commerce sales have benefited the industry.",
