    "executive_summary": "The Gas Stations industry has experienced significant revenue volatility over the past five years. The industry is sensitive to trends in oil prices because it largely retails gasoline. A decline in the world price of crude oil because of the COVID-19 pandemic led to a substantial decline in revenue in 2020. The pandemic also contributed to the reduction in total vehicle miles, resulting in lower demand for fuel. In contrast, 2021 and 2022 saw fuel prices skyrocket as pent up demand was unleashed, supply chain challenges and geopolitical developments hampered global oil markets. Overall, industry revenue is expected to increase at a CAGR of 2.5% to $140.5 billion over the five years to 2024, including a 1.1% increase in 2024 alone.",

            "current_performance_point_description": "The volatility of crude oil prices over the past five years has posed considerable challenges for the Gas Stations industry. Volatility has been caused by COVID-19, supply chain disruptions and geopolitical tensions like the Russia-Ukraine war. Because gasoline prices are tied directly to the cost of crude oil, drastic fluctuations in oil prices directly impact the cost of gasoline that stations supply and the final price set for consumers at the pump."

            "current_performance_point_title": "High oil prices impact on gas stations",
            "current_performance_point_description": "High oil prices can both positively and negatively impact gas stations, depending on their ability to respond and adapt. When oil prices rise, gas stations can potentially benefit from higher markup on gasoline, resulting in increased per-gallon profit. However, higher oil prices lead to increased gasoline prices, which can reduce consumer demand as people might cut back on driving or switch to more fuel-efficient modes of transportation."

            "current_performance_point_description": "Along with a growing economy, consumers and businesses have spent steadily on fuel. Vehicle fuel is a relatively nondiscretionary good because most consumers require gasoline to drive on a daily basis. As the number of employees in the United States has continued to increase, more people have driven daily, increasing demand for vehicle fuel. Furthermore, as per capita disposable income has grown, some consumers traded up to premium and diesel fuel, benefiting industry revenue."

            "current_performance_point_title": "Diesel fuel demand",
            "current_performance_point_description": "Diesel fuel sales have increased due to growth in the transportation sector. Both the Local Freight Trucking industry and Long-Distance Freight Trucking industry have experienced revenue growth over the past five years, driven by increasing demand for trucking from various manufacturers and retailers. Because the sale of diesel fuel represents nearly half of industry revenue, improving sales and increasing diesel fuel prices have helped improve revenue performance."

More consumers and truck drivers have turned to retail sites that operate convenience stores on-site due to the access to food, beverages and cigarettes, among other sundries. Items sold in convenience stores are more profitable than gasoline, shielding operators somewhat from rising credit card swipe fees and giving them a competitive edge against stand-alone gas stations."

            "current_performance_point_description": "The world price of oil has grown over the past five years, hindering profit growth as gas stations have been unable to trim margins as prices at the pump soared. Credit card swipe fees have also grown as consumers increasingly used debit or credit cards rather than cash to make purchases, leading to higher operating expenses. The industry's low margins have led upstream fuel conglomerates to divest from their retail portfolios."

Growth in disposable income will enable consumers to purchase higher grades of vehicle fuel, increasing revenue per customer. Furthermore, as more diesel-compatible cars are introduced, consumers are anticipated to opt for these vehicles because of their higher fuel efficiency, increasing demand for diesel fuel. Consumer demand for premium-grade gasoline will grow as consumers purchase an increasing number of luxury cars requiring more expensive fuel."

            "future_outlook_point_description": "The world price of crude oil will decrease consistently over the next five years, following the extreme increases during the previous period. This will cause the retail price of fuel to also drop. The decrease in fuel prices will depress gas stations' revenue as stations will become more price competitive and have to pass on the lower prices to consumers to attract customers. It should be noted that the timing and nature of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) production quota changes are difficult to forecast, and any changes by the organization can alter oil volumes and prices significantly."

The Energy Information Association expects the total amount of energy used by light-duty vehicles to experience a double-digit decline until 2040. Despite an increase in total vehicle miles, greater fuel efficiency will lower the need for fuel. As hybrid and electronic vehicles become more affordable and more widely available, an increasing number of consumers will purchase these vehicles, further lowering demand for gasoline. Gas stations will need to adopt new strategies to remain competitive in the face of changing consumer preferences. Gas stations will start selling more eco-friendly fuel blends and incorporating electric car charging stations into their operations."

According to the National Association of Convenience Stores, consumers are increasingly purchasing gasoline based on convenience and price, rather than brand; in response, gas stations are increasingly offering discounts through loyalty programs for consumers during periods of gas price volatility. Nevertheless, as younger consumers become eligible to drive, more consumers will turn to stores that offer a variety of goods in addition to vehicle fuel. More gas stations will opt for more profitable stations with convenience stores rather than stand-alone fuel stations, precepting an exit from the industry as establishments are reclassified to the Gas Stations with Convenience Stores industry."
