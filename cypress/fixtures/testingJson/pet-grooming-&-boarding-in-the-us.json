    "executive_summary": "Figures have been adjusted for inflation and are presented in 2024 currency. Households have increasingly come to consider pets to be an integral part of the family. In recent years, a record-high pet ownership rate boosted spending on pet care services, including grooming and boarding. The pet care sector has flourished as pet owners sought the best for their pets \u2013 which materialized in this industry through services like high-end boarding and luxury grooming packages. The pandemic disrupted the industry's growth trajectory: work-from-home arrangements and travel restrictions left more pet owners at home, lowering the need for pet care services and leading revenue to sink for the first time in more than two decades. At the same time, a spike in pet ownership during the pandemic created a shift for the industry that saw demand for pet grooming and boarding ultimately increase to such an extent that it outpaced supply. Pet owners' steep spending on pets has led industry-wide revenue to expand at an estimated CAGR of 6.0% over the last five years, totaling approximately $14.7 billion and including an expected 1.3% increase in 2024 alone.",

Pet owners are more willing to shell out on services prioritizing their companions' health and well-being. Millennial pet parents in particular show their willingness to pay top dollar for their pets. Spending behaviors on pets more closely mirror spending on popular consumer trends. Pet owners are spending more on premium pet stays than on traditional boarding."

Work-from-home setups and travel restrictions left pet owners with more time at home to spend with pets, depressing demand for pet boarding. Temporary closures brought substantial financial challenges to pet care service providers. When businesses reopened amid the pandemic, hesitant pet owners deferred pet care like grooming and training sessions because of safety concerns. Grooming services were slightly more resistant to the pandemic's effects since grooming is necessary for some breeds."

Few barriers to entry and little oversight make it relatively easy for new companies to enter the Pet Grooming and Boarding industry. More pet care facilities will offer amenities for animals like pools, playgrounds and games to attract pet owners as competition expands. Technology's role is limited in the pet care space but tech features like webcams and online booking platforms will become expected by discerning pet owners. According to the American Pet Products Association in March 2023, use of pet monitoring systems is increasing."
