            "question": "Do you monitor changes in the trade-weighted index? Does a depreciating dollar pose a threat to your earnings?",
            "answer": "The trade-weighted index indicates the strength of a domestic currency relative to those of a country's trade partners. An increase in the value of the US dollar relative to foreign currencies reduces the attractiveness of US exports, such as agricultural commodities and natural resources. This leads to a decrease in commodity prices, leading to decreased revenue for industry operators. However, volatility is ultimately what benefits commodity traders, so a decrease in prices does not necessarily on its own pose a risk. For brokers, who also comprise a share of industry operators, a decline in prices might pose more of a direct effect on revenue since they generate revenue through commissions on trades."
