    "executive_summary": "Heavy engineering contractors complete projects such as constructing oceanic navigational channels, beach dredging, mass transit support construction, tunnels, hydroelectric power plants and conservation development. Most of these projects are carried out by state and local governments independently or in conjunction with the federal government, so industry revenue tracks most closely with movements in public funding. Over the past five years, heavy engineering construction revenue has expanded at a CAGR of 1.1% to reach $34.4 billion in 2024, when revenue is set to grow 0.1%. Industry revenue has exhibited conflicting trends due to the COVID-19 pandemic, with nonresidential construction suffering mightily. As commodities prices, particularly crude oil, have been highly volatile, private investment in heavy engineering projects has been uneven. However, public funding for infrastructure projects has remained relatively stable, buoying industry revenue.",

            "question": "How does your company manage price risk in regard to demand for differing product segments?",
            "answer": "Demand for specific types of construction will fluctuate depending on demand conditions. As demand fluctuates, output prices will also fluctuate. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, demand for nonresidential construction has fallen sharply amid a decline in capital expenditure from downstream customers. Furthermore, competition for public dollars amid rising federal spending and weakness in state and local tax revenue has caused demand for industry services to decline."
        },
        {
            "question": "How does your company manage interest rate risk?",
            "answer": "Yields on the 10-year Treasury and other long-term bonds will affect investment mix as they rise due to rising interest rates on 30-year commercial mortgages. As borrowing costs rise, funding of major projects may become scarce and industry operators may need to scale down operations. Locking in low-interest rates via a fixed-rate contract can protect industry operators from potential increases in interest rates and keep the cost of debt from rising, freeing cash flow for current operations."
        },
        {
            "question": "How does your company manage market risk?",
            "answer": "As a result of the coronavirus pandemic, end-market activity has been highly volatile. Due to a downturn in private demand for industry construction and amid a tightening in public dollars as local and state governments increase unemployment liabilities. To hedge against market risk it is imperative that industry operators enter into long-term service contracts for maintenance, ensuring steady revenue flows during periods of market-downturn."
        },
        {
            "question": "How does your company manage input-price risk?",
            "answer": "Building materials such as cement and lumber have been in high demand during the coronavirus pandemic. Rising prices due to limited supplies has caused some industry operators to reflect declines in profitability due to rising operating costs. To protect themselves from rising costs, industry operators should enter into long-term purchasing contracts with upstream suppliers and lock in rates, obtaining upside protection."
        },
        {
            "question": "Has your company employed drone technology on job sites?",
            "answer": "With the Federal Aviation Administration's recent ruling on commercial drone usage, it is now legal to use commercial drones under a certain height limit without licensure. This opens up many avenues for industry operators to employ this labor-saving technology to scope out job sites, 3D map buildings and heat map constructions. Overall, the increased operational efficiency and the resultant decline in wage costs is likely to boost operator operating profit as a result."
        },
        {
            "question": "Has your company increased returns on capital?",
            "answer": "This industry is primarily labor-intensive, and the most efficient method of reducing labor costs is via the subcontracting of nonessential employees. However, it is also possible to reduce reliance on labor by increasing capital intensity and adopting a more capital-intensive operating model. By leveraging gains in technology and capital, industry operators can increase operating profit via a reduction in labor costs and increase in return on capital employed such as heavy machinery or drones."
        },
        {
            "question": "How does your company ensure all health and safety requirements are met on and off the construction site?",
            "answer": "With the current administration walking back deregulations enacted by its predecessor, it is likely that operating costs related to worker health and safety may rise in the short-term. As a result, profitability may be weakened. However, companies that have a penchant for strong safety standards, and a low incidence rate on job sites, will likely be faced with lower insurance premiums and costs, while also setting the standard for the industry, ultimately enhancing operating profit."
        },
        {
            "question": "Is your company prepared to adapt to shifting environmental regulations?",
            "answer": "With the current administration's rejoining of the Paris Climate Accord, operating costs related to carbon emissions as well as procurement of similar supplies may rise. This increase in regulation will be most felt by companies that do not exhibit a strong reputation for environmentally friendly construction methods. Those with a penchant for sustainable building will likely be favored by the market while also being less inhibited by rising regulation."
        },
        {
            "question": "In a market with essentially substitutable products, how does your company differentiate itself from its major competitors?",
            "answer": "Companies can best distinguish themselves from their competition via a reputation for on-time deliverables, under-budget projects, and quality construction. Overall, since industry products are mostly substitutable, a contract tender may be won by offering quality service and via a strong word-of-mouth reputation. Overall, industry marketing costs are minimal."
        },
        {
            "question": "Has your company faced any cashflow issues amid the dearth of construction projects at the height of the pandemic?",
            "answer": "Overall, revenue from projects is recognized once a project is completed, creating a lag between work done and revenue gains. As a result, industry operators must have strong cash flow in order to procure supplies, pay workers and finish the project before they can be paid. Essentially this comes down to the fact that investments in construction are considered risky since the product being paid for does not yet exist. To keep cashflow free, industry operators should take advantage of low-interest rates, debt refinances options, as well as having cash reserves to cover operating costs when work slows down."
        },
        {
            "question": "How does your company attract skilled and accredited engineers? Have you had any past issues in accessing a highly skilled workforce?",
            "answer": "Labor is one of the most expensive components of the industry cost structure since skilled and accredited engineers and other professionals cost a premium. Overall, labor costs can be lowered via the subcontracting of nonessential labor and only keeping skilled employees on the books as full-time."
        },
        {
            "question": "Do you have a good relationship with your subcontractors? How do you decide which subcontractors to do business with?",
            "answer": "Having good working relationships with subcontracting building trade specialists is important. Subcontractors are one of the easiest ways to control costs on a construction project. The prime contractor will win the tender for a contract and then may enlist subcontractors in order to perform construction work, while full-time employees will design and engineering industry projects."
        },
        {
            "question": "Has your company been able to increase productivity via the adoption of technology? What new technology have you recently adopted?",
            "answer": "Via the adoption of technology, industry operators can increase productivity which will in turn increase industry profitability. Technology is rapidly advancing and must be continuously leveraged in order to remain competitive."
        },
        {
            "question": "Do you monitor changes in the value of the 10-year Treasury note? What deals can you secure now before interest rates increase further?",
            "answer": "The yield is analogous to the current interest rate demanded by the market to hold this debt for 10 years. A higher yield translates to higher borrowing costs for the public sector and dissuades industry investment."
        },
        {
            "question": "Is your company overly dependent on public dollars to finance projects? Do you have plans to change the level of public financing your company receives?",
            "answer": "Since a large portion of industry activity is undertaken by state and local governments, increases in their investment outlays will benefit industry growth."
        },
        {
            "question": "Do you track investments the government makes in your industry? How have fluctuations in government investments affected your company?",
            "answer": "Outlays for transportation are used to service interstate transportation, such as navigable waterways, interstate passenger rail and highways. When industry-relevant projects receive federal funding, industry revenue rises."
