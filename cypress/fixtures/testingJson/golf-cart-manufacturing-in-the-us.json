Although the standard golf cart has emerged as a convenient method of transportation for security personnel, retirement communities, families and other businesses and organizations, the primary market for golf carts remains the Golf Courses and Country Clubs industry (IBISWorld report 71391). While the COVID-19 pandemic sparked consumer interest in golf, health and safety regulations prevented manufacturers from fully capitalizing on evolving consumer tastes. Instead, inexpensive imports filled gaps in demand. Over the past five years, industry revenue has been falling at a CAGR of 5.4% and is expected to reach $1.2 billion in 2023, including a 0.2% contraction in 2023 alone.",

When course visits decline, the impact reverberates through the supply chain to golf cart manufacturers. The pandemic revived interest in golf, especially with younger generations. Golf courses continued to operate while most leisure activities shut down. Many courses offered reduced green fees and discounted memberships to capitalize on rising demand."

Currently, most electric carts manage three to five horsepower, while gas-powered carts can reach twelve horsepower. For example, the newest 48-volt carts from Club Car can reach 10.0 horsepower.

Golf courses require significant movement between each shot. Although walking is possible, it is undesirable for most golfers, especially casual and elderly players. Golfers are often older and wealthy, so long walks in the hot sun are unpalatable. The nature of golfing protects the industry from disruption and replacement by another movement method. Any changes in the actual engineering and manufacturing of the carts would not be a disruption.
