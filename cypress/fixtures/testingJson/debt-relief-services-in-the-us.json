Demand for the industry's services often surges during bad economic times because businesses and individuals have trouble paying their debts. This didn't happen during COVID-19 despite the massive recession because of record-low interest rates and soaring per capita disposable income. These factors enabled consumers to pay their bills and avoid going into more debt, hindering demand for the industry's services and causing revenue to plunge in 2020.",

Despite poor economic conditions during the pandemic, revenue fell precipitously in 2020. The Federal Reserve used quantitative easing during COVID-19 to prevent a total economic collapse. This caused interest rates to plunge, making it easier for households and businesses to pay off existing debt and hindering providers' performance."

Stable economic growth will boost wages and increase per capita disposable income. This will cause aggregate household debt to fall since consumers will have the increased funds to reduce their liabilities. High GDP growth will cause corporate profit to rise, making it easier for businesses to pay off their debt. As debt burdens for businesses and households fall, demand for the industry's services will diminish, contributing to declining revenue during the outlook period."

The central bank wants room to bring them down when a recession occurs. Since interest rates will remain high, debt relief service providers will extract a significant amount of interest income from their existing customers, giving them an essential revenue stream in an environment of falling demand for their services. High-interest rates on mortgages and other products will put some households and businesses in financial trouble, raising downstream demand for the industry's services somewhat."

Since the industry's companies operate on a for-profit basis, these claims will become more acute. As debt relief companies become viewed as more exploitative, financially struggling consumers will increasingly migrate to non-profit organizations that offer similar services, inducing a long-term decline in demand and revenue for the industry."
