    "executive_summary": "Figures have been adjusted for inflation and are presented in 2024 currency. Households now consider pets as an integral part of the family more than ever. In recent years, a record-high pet ownership rate and shifting attitudes have boosted spending on pet care services, including transportation. The broader pet care sector has flourished as pet owners sought the best for their pets. The industry's growth trajectory was disrupted by the COVID-19 pandemic, as work-from-home settings and travel restrictions left more pet owners at home than ever before, leading revenue to sink for the first time in a decade. Yet an unprecedented spike in pet ownership during the pandemic has shifted the industry's landscape, with demand for pet transportation services outpacing supply post-COVID. Pet owners' steep spending on pets has led industry-wide revenue to expand at a CAGR of 0.7% over the past five years, totaling an estimated $2.2 billion, including an expected 0.9% increase in 2024.",
