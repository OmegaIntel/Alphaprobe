    "executive_summary": "The Corrosion Protection Engineering Services industry is busy managing the corrosion of aging US infrastructure and protecting new projects from its harmful effects. Over the five years to 2022, the industry has benefited as a wide range of downstream utilities, construction and transportation industries have increased investment in infrastructure, necessitating corrosion management services. However volatile energy prices have resulted in divergent demand trends throughout the current period.",

The Trump administration made defense spending a priority. This is expected to continue into the Biden Administration, which has seen the emergence of new geopolitical conflicts, chiefly Russia's invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. Thus, federal funding for defense has increased at an annualized rate of 2.6% over the five years to 2022, resulting in more funding for corrosion protection engineering services. This has also benefited industry profit, measured as earnings before interest and taxes, which is expected to reach 10.3% of revenue in 2022."

Furthermore, the economic landscape deteriorated considerably in 2020 as the coronavirus pandemic disrupted global supply chains and demand as it spread globally. The surge in energy prices since 2021 has propelled industry revenue to growth, as strong global demand, pandemic related supply chain challenges and perhaps most importantly, geopolitical conflicts including Russia's invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 resulting in a spike prices."

The industrial production index, a measure of these industries' total output, is expected to increase at an annualized rate of 1.4% over the five years to 2027, encouraging investment into new structures and equipment, which will likely boost demand for corrosion engineers. With the negative effects of corrosion costing an estimated 3.1% of the nation's GDP annually, there are profit opportunities for companies that can mitigate these costs."
