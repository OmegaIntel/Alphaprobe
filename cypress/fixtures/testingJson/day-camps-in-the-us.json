    "executive_summary": "Consistent growth in the popularity of extracurricular activities and a robust emphasis on physical activity has enhanced demand for day camp operators. The ability for children of all ages to socialize and interact in a variety of physical and skill-based activities created a unique incentive for parents, with growing rates of sports participation and total recreational expenditure accelerating these trends. Day camp operators were initially hit hard by COVID-19, as the effects of lockdowns and social distancing measures significantly harmed operator demand. However, a rapid economic reopening, boosted by the proliferation of the COVID-19 vaccine, helped ease parents' concerns surrounding their kids' personal health and created robust demand for day camp operators. In recent years, the overall industry continues to benefit from an expansion of specialized activities aimed at improving the well-roundedness of kids' skills and favorable demographic trends that create a larger customer base. This has resulted in revenue growing at a CAGR of 2.6% to an estimated $489.0 million over the past five years, including an estimated 0.5% boost in 2024.",
