Therefore, before COVID-19, the industry benefited from a surge of retiring baby boomers who typically have ample leisure time and retirement income to travel. Both international and domestic travel rates slumped drastically after the coronavirus hit, deteriorating demand for accommodations in general. Also, many bed & breakfast and hostel operators were forced to temporarily shutter operations due to local restrictions and health concerns. As a result, industry revenue is estimated to have plunged 27.8% in 2020 alone."

However, optimism crackled for these small stalwarts arising from recent crackdowns on house-sharing services in major metropolitan areas. This unexpected regulatory shift has potentially swung open doors for bed & breakfasts and hostels, redirecting consumers back into their landscape."

To maintain their market share, hostels will offer significant competitive advantages like sightseeing and cultural tours, day excursions, bar crawls and other value-added services.
