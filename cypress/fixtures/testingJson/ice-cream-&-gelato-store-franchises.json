    "executive_summary": "Ice cream and gelato have remained popular dessert items among consumers, as demonstrated by growth in the Ice Cream and Gelato Store Franchises industry over the five years to 2021. Positive economic conditions have offset rising health consciousness trends during the period. Growth in per capita disposable income has enabled consumers to spend on discretionary products and try high-margin, premium products offered by industry operators. Additionally, steady per capita dairy consumption has sustained demand for ice cream and gelato. However, increased competition from substitute products that are deemed healthier, such as frozen yogurt, have mitigated revenue growth somewhat.",

Consumers are increasingly demanding healthier options and refraining from consuming products heavy in sugar and dairy. Alternative products, such as frozen yogurt and other healthier frozen treats, have gained popularity over the past five years. Although many industry operators have responded by diversifying their product portfolios to include juices, smoothies and low fat and low sugar products, heightened competition has mitigated revenue growth."

            "current_performance_point_description": "However, as growth in per capita dairy consumption slows, top industry operators have seen declines in the total number of franchise units, leading to a fall in market share concentration. Both per capita dairy consumption and per capita sugar and sweetener consumption are anticipated to decrease over the five years to 2026. Consequently, consumers' eating habits are expected to continue trending toward healthy snacks and desserts, leading to a fall in demand for ice cream and gelato and heightened competition among industry operators."

Consumers are increasingly moving away from ice cream and gelato stores, as the level of health consciousness in the United States rises. However, ice cream and gelato's popularity during warm summer months is expected to cushion the industry from overall declines in demand."

However, the seasonality of ice cream and gelato continues to ensure relatively steady demand for industry operators, and this trend is expected to continue during the outlook period. These products come with a premium, but health-conscious consumers are willing to pay more for these products, which represents an opportunity for industry operators over the next five years."
