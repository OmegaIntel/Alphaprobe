The influx of foreign manufacturers, particularly from nations with lower production costs, has created a challenging environment for domestic producers. Still, US-based manufacturers have held their ground and expanded in some sectors, largely because of successful differentiation strategies, superior quality and a strong domestic consumer base. Industry revenue has boosted at a CAGR of 1.5% over the past five years and is expected to total $3.5 billion in 2024, when revenue will drop by an estimated 0.2%.",
