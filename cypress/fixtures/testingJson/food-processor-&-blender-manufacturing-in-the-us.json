    "executive_summary": "Figures have been adjusted for inflation and are presented in 2023 currency. Food processor and blender manufacturers make electric- and motor-driven appliances used in food preparation. The strong economy in the years before the COVID-19 pandemic caused per capita disposable income to rise, enabling consumers to spend more on the industry's products, which raised revenue. Social distancing and mask-wearing rules made industrial production more difficult when the pandemic hit. The supply of many of the industry's key inputs fell, constraining revenue for manufacturers. Supply chain disruptions ensued during the COVID-19 pandemic's recovery, causing plastic prices to soar. Since plastic is a primary input for food processors and blenders, high plastic prices have caused revenue to skyrocket recently because manufacturers have been able to pass on high costs to their buyers.",
