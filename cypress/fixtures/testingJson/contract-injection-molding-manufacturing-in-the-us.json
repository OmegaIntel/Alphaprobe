    "executive_summary": "Figures have been adjusted for inflation and are presented in 2024 currency.\n\nInjection molding is the most common method of manufacturing plastic parts, which is particularly suitable for high-volume projects. Demand for contracted injection molding manufacturing services generally reflects growth in the broader manufacturing sector, which in turn is influenced by consumer spending, corporate profit, international trade and government investment. Similar to the broader manufacturing sector, demand for injection molding manufacturing services dipped in 2020 amid the pandemic and bounced back in 2021 as a result of stimulus packages and inventory buildups. However, elevated interest rates and economic uncertainty contributed to industry declines lately. Overall, industry revenue has remained largely unchanged during the period, with revenues growing at a CAGR of 0.3% to reach $18.7 billion in 2024, including an expected 0.4% decline in 2024 alone.",

Slowing economic growth and the trade war with China contributed to a decline in the manufacturing sector in 2019. This trend was boosted in 2020 with the pandemic outbreak, which led to changing consumer preferences and supply chain disruptions. Declining plastic costs through 2020 further contributed to lower revenues."

As demand for goods and services increased, so did demand for injection molding manufacturing services. Ultimately, the industry saw strong growth in 2021, followed by more modest growth in 2022."

Rapidly growing interest rates have made it more expensive to make new purchases, such as new auto, and led to concerns regarding the possibility of a recession. In 2024, demand for manufactured goods is projected to remain muted, although an expected cut in interest rates later in the year will have a positive impact on the industry and the broader manufacturing sector overall."

Plastic prices experienced strong growth between May 2020 and August 2021, followed by a gradual decline through the end of 2023. Growing plastic prices through August 2021 generally reflected a disbalance between rapidly growing demand for plastics and constrained supply. A supply chain recovery coupled with slowing economic growth contributed to a downward trend in plastic prices."
