    "executive_summary": "Over the five years to 2021, the Commercial Shelving Manufacturing industry has experienced volatility before ultimately ending in decline. For much of the period, the key economic drivers of demand for commercial shelving experienced steady growth. However, pressure from imports constrained industry growth during most of the period. Moreover, in 2020, the onset of the COVID-19 (coronavirus) pandemic resulted in a decline in demand for industry products. The decline in economic activity and increased prevalence of traditional office workers working from home contributed to a decline in demand for industry products. Overall, during the five-year period, industry revenue is expected to decline at an annualized rate of 3.3% to $4.5 billion, despite an estimated 1.4% increase in 2021 alone.",
