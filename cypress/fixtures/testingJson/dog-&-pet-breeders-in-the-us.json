    "executive_summary": "Over the five years to 2024, increases in both competition and public disapproval have threatened the Dog and Pet Breeders industry. This industry includes various operations, from small independent home breeders to large USDA-certified breeding facilities. However, the industry also comprises unlicensed puppy mills, often using inhumane practices to reduce costs and maximize profit. Recent attention to these operations has hurt the overall industry's reputation. In 2017, the 'Adopt, Don't Shop' campaign emphasized the ethical benefits of getting pets from shelters and adoption groups rather than pet stores. This campaign has led many pet stores to no longer work with breeders and instead host adoption events with local shelters. Over the five years to 2024, industry revenue is expected to grow at an annualized rate of 2.6% to $3.1 billion, including an estimated 0.9% decline in 2024.",

This scientific advancement supports a more robust gene pool, which is crucial for responsible breeding practices. Optimized pairings based on genetic insights improve physical traits, temperaments and longevity. Breeders can more effectively align pets with breed standards and consumer preferences. Health guarantees have become a key selling point, increasing buyer confidence in pets' genetic background and overall health."

The rise of awareness and tighter regulations regarding animal abuse in large-scale breeding operations has significantly tarnished the industry's image. Consumers now scrutinize breeding practices more closely, affecting breeder revenue streams. Launched in 2017, the 'Adopt, Don't Shop' campaign has played a crucial role in customer preference for pet adoption over purchase. Major pet retailers like PetSmart and PetCo have ceased selling dogs and cats. Instead, they focus on hosting adoption events in collaboration with local animal shelters."

This regulation limits breeders' growth by imposing legal requirements. Most US pet breeders don't surpass the 25-animal threshold and operate without employer status. There are more than 300,000 pet breeders, yet only 2,805 hold a USDA license. This small percentage highlights the restrictive nature of federal regulations."

Animal rights groups advocate for stricter regulations, which puts continuous pressure on authorities to take action.

This demographic increasingly prioritizes ethical treatment of animals, often viewing adoption as a more humane alternative to purchasing from breeders, driving further support for these organizations."
