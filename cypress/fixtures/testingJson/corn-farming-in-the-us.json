Revenue for the corn farming industry has been volatile over the last five years because corn prices and demand have fluctuated dramatically. The outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic caused a downturn in revenue after the supply chain backed up and products were left unsold, but a subsequent uptick in demand, massive increases in exports and boosted oil production caused revenue to skyrocket in 2021 and 2022. As a result of these outliers, revenue has risen at a CAGR of 5.1% in the current period to an expected $75.2 billion in 2024.",

Corn farmers benefited from a huge jump in revenue that lasted into 2022. Ethanol's primary input material is corn, so rising demand for ethanol leads to higher corn prices \u2013 and heightened revenue and profit for corn farmers who can provide corn for biofuel production."

A large portion of this jump came from China, which tripled its imports of US corn from 2020 to 2021 when Ukraine \u2013 the other primary supplier of corn \u2013 was cut off from trade amid the Russian invasion.

But the projected decline in the price of oil will likely lead to a decrease in demand for ethanol, and corn by extension. Corn's relevance to the ethanol manufacturing process is fairly secure, with corn accounting for 94.0% of ethanol production. However, emerging alternatives like sugarcane may siphon away some demand for corn."

Still, exports will grow as a share of revenue as domestic markets struggle with lower corn prices.
