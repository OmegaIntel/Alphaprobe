The number of adults aged 65 and older has increased at a much faster pace compared with growth in children, adolescents and younger adults. The use of emergency medical services (EMS) increases with age; therefore, strong growth in the number of adults aged 65 and older is contributing to demand growth."

Consequently, the removal of barriers under this act enabled industry growth. Consolidation among hospital providers has driven down the number of specialty care facilities and emergency departments. This has made it more likely that patients need to be transferred between healthcare facilities to access an appropriate level of care."

This and other reasons have also subjected the industry to increased regulatory scrutiny in the period. Large bills sent to patients and a lack of transparency have increasingly drawn the industry to the attention of legislators. No pricing limits, high fixed costs and a high level of competition have dramatically raised prices over the past decade."
