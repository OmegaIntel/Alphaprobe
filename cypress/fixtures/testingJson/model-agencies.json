    "executive_summary": "Operators in the Model Agencies industry represent fashion models in business dealings, such as auditions, bookings and contract negotiations. Downstream demand is highly dependent on corporate advertising expenditure, as a significant share of industry revenue is generated through commissions and service fees earned from bookings for TV, retail and online campaigns. Over the majority of the five years to 2022, strong economic conditions encouraged consumer spending which, in turn, led total advertising expenditure to increase as corporations sought to market their offerings, boosting demand for the industry. However, demand quickly declined following the COVID-19 (coronavirus) pandemic, as companies cut spending on advertising while photoshoots and popular fashion events were deterred. Widespread vaccine availability and recovering economic conditions between 2021 and 2022 have largely fueled an industry recovery, as companies increase advertising expenditure to meet consumers' pent-up demand for goods. In all, industry revenue is expected to decline an annualized 0.6% to $1.6 billion over the five years to 2022, including an increase of 1.9% in 2022.",
