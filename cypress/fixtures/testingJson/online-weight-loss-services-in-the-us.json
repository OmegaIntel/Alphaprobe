    "executive_summary": "Figures have been adjusted for inflation and are presented in 2023 currency.\n\nIndustry demand has been driven by the prevalence of obesity in the domestic population coupled with continued adoption of internet platforms. Consumers that have become increasingly comfortable using the internet have turned toward industry players for weight management consultations, products, and resources. Even the largest weight loss enterprises have continually invested in online platforms to provide services, benefiting from large existing client bases. This dynamic was further amplified by the restrictive environment created by the pandemic. Total industry revenue has increased at a CAGR of 0.5% to reach $1.9 billion in revenue, including an expansion of 4.3% in 2023 alone as profit reaches 7.2%.\n\nIndustry trends are largely the result of rising levels of per capita disposable income and the permeation of digital platforms into traditional services. Disposable income levels have mounted benefiting from government stimulus efforts in the wake of the pandemic. While many discretionary purchases have been tapered in the pandemic's recessionary environment, the prevalence of adult obesity would incentivize many individuals to invest in weight management. The restrictive health and safety conditions from the pandemic increased the percentage of business conducted online, directly benefiting industry enterprises.",
