However, primary care doctors and the healthcare industry in the United States are navigating a complex landscape influenced by shifting demographics, economic factors, technological advancements and the enduring fallout of COVID-19. Despite a growing need for primary care doctor services propelled by an aging population, there is a noticeable dip in interest from younger adults opting for alternative healthcare alternatives like telemedicine, outpatient facilities and urgent care centers. The scarcity of primary care physicians, particularly in geriatric care specialties, presents concerns related to burnout, reduced access to care and the need to recruit medical students to address the escalating healthcare needs.",
