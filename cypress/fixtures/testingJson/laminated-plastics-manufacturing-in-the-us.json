    "executive_summary": "The laminated plastics manufacturing industry produces plastic sheets, shapes, plates and rods sold to various manufacturing sectors. It is sensitive to macroeconomic drivers like construction activity and consumer spending. During the COVID-19 pandemic, demand from downstream markets plunged, causing revenue to decline. As the economy reopened in 2021, the industrial sector revived, benefiting manufacturers who purchased laminated plastics. However, the Russia-Ukraine war caused oil prices to surge, reducing profit and revenue as manufacturers couldn't pass on high costs. The Federal Reserve raised interest rates to curb inflation, inhibiting construction demand for the industry's products. Overall, industry revenue declined at a 1.3% CAGR through 2024 to $4.7 billion, with profit at 3.7% of revenue in 2024, down from 4.1% in 2019.",
