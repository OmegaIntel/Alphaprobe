    "executive_summary": "The emergence of new media and the shift away from traditional media toward digital services has particularly prompted a change in advertising strategies. Since almost all companies are undergoing a digital transformation, media buying agencies must specialize in online advertising to adapt to the changing media landscape. Many companies have been able to do this effectively. Nonetheless, inflation hit a fresh 40-year record in 2022, pulling back on ad spending and causing corporate profit and consumer spending to drop. While this dynamic has since eased, the industry has been forced to innovate to sustain demand amid uncertain economic conditions. Data-driven insights and programmatic advertising have propelled the industry's growth.",

Media buying agencies have turned to external services and tools to show viewers more relevant ads based on preference to minimize ad-skipping."

Media buying agencies will prioritize brand safety measures to ensure that ads are displayed in suitable environments and protect clients from associating with harmful content. Additionally, a heightened focus will be on combating ad fraud through verification tools and partnerships with reputable publishers.
