Most industry operators are dedicated to growing hay, though the low margin nature of this product causes it to only account for roughly one-quarter of industry revenue, despite the overwhelming number of industry establishments being hay farmers. Overall, industry revenue performance has been bolstered by annualized increases in the value of each industry product segment, with 2023 preliminary results indicating double digit growth in the revenue earned from and hay. Other segment leaders include outdoor grown marijuana and hops. Industry revenue is expected to have increased at a CAGR of 0.3% over the five years to 2023 to reach $37.9 billion, including an estimated 1.2% decrease in 2023 alone as sweetener consumption falls.",

Therefore, farmers in the Hay and Crop Farming industry have been making the switch to organic, which trades at a premiium."
        },
        {
            "question": "With diverging prices occurring at the farm gate and among processors and retailers, how does your company hedge against price loss risk?",
            "answer": "Due to supply chain disruptions caused by the outbreak of COVID-19, farm prices have been weak while processed food prices have soared. Industry operators can hedge against price loss risk by producing a variety of products or by switching cropping activities, ensuring they are not exposed to price loss."
        },
        {
            "question": "Via potential labor shortages due to reforms regarding the HB1 Visa Program, how does your company plan to limit rising wage pressure?",
            "answer": "Reforms to seasonal laborer laws might serve to increase industry wages and operating costs in the short term, which suggests industry operators should move to a more capital-intensive model to limit rising wage pressure."

        {
            "question": "Is your company threatened by the looming rise of lab-grown, synthetic meats?",
            "answer": "Hay is a major feed source for livestock, such as cattle. With recent advancements and breakthroughs surrounding lab-grown meat, the industry has the potential to be undercut by meat that requires no feed and costs a fraction of what traditionally raised livestock do."

        {
            "question": "It is highly illegal to sell falsely labeled organic produce. How does your company ensure it follows all rules and regulations?",
            "answer": "Organic crops carry a significant premium, with some trading in excess of 200.0% of their traditionally grown counterparts. Organically focused farms take on more risk since they cannot use traditional pesticides and herbicides, so as a result organic produce is sold at a higher per-unit price on the market."

            "question": "Is there capacity to increase export volumes? How will new tariff policies affect your export revenue?",
            "answer": "Exports account for a significant industry revenue and represent a critical market. As exports decline, the domestic market floods with commodities and domestic prices will decline. Maintaining a healthy level of exports gives industry farmers a measure of control over domestic pricing conditions."

            "question": "What measures does your company take to hedge against climate and weather risk?",
            "answer": "Weather conditions play an important role in determining crop yields and production levels, given that favorable weather patterns boost crop yields. Some crops can be grown under cover which will cost more but often sell at a higher value, indicating growing crops under cover can mitigate climate risk."
        },
        {
            "question": "With volatile beef and livestock prices, how has your company ensured consistent sales to livestock and beef?",
            "answer": "Livestock farmers regularly purchase hay as feed for their herds. Demand for hay usually increases during adverse weather conditions when the area of natural pastures is lower. Additionally, via marketing organic hay, industry operators can sell at a higher premium."
