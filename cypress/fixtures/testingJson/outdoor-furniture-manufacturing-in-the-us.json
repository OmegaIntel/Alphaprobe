    "executive_summary": "Outdoor furniture producers have endured significant volatility in recent years. Since households are the largest market for outdoor furniture, demand typically rises with improved disposable income and greater housing starts. However, heightened macroeconomic uncertainty and significant competition from imported products pushed demand for domestic outdoor furniture down despite the economy reopening in 2021. Similarly, manufacturers have endured significant input price volatility, particularly impacting steel, wood, and plastic prices. Manufacturers' inability to pass down cost increases to buyers places downward pressure on profit, discouraging domestic production. These trends have caused demand for new outdoor furniture to shrink at an estimated CAGR of 6.8% to $1.7 billion through the end of 2024, including a 5.3% drop that year alone.",
