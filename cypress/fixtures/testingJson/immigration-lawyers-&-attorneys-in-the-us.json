        {
            "question": "How have recent economic conditions influenced consumer demand for your company's services?",
            "answer": "As macroeconomic conditions improve, immigrants are more likely to seek permanent citizenship in the United States. This will boost spending on immigration lawyers and attorneys' services. The elimination of country quotas controlling Eastern Hemisphere immigration, the increases in annual limits for hemispheric and preference immigration and the inclusion of parents of adult US citizens as immediate relatives that are numerically exempt have all boosted the number of migrants to the United States, boosting revenue. The 1967 United Nations Protocol relating to the Status of Refugees prohibits any nation from returning refugees to a country where their life or freedom would be threatened. The United States ratified this in 1968, increasing the number of refugees and spending on the services offered by immigration lawyers and attorneys. The pandemic caused Congress to pass the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP), which enabled companies to receive forgivable loans from the federal government to pay for lost wages and rents because of social distancing regulations and quarantines. While immigration lawyers and attorneys stayed operating because their services were essential, some players took advantage of PPP loans, as they were negatively affected by the social distancing rules and the big drop in spending that resulted from the pandemic."

        {
            "question": "To what degree are your company's operations capital intensive?",
            "answer": "The years of schooling that immigration lawyers and attorneys must complete before practicing law enables them to command high wages. Lawyers and attorneys require very little capital to operate, which causes capital intensity to be low."

            "question": "Does your company benefit, either directly or indirectly, from any government legislation?",
