    "executive_summary": "The Forklift Manufacturing industry primarily manufactures forklifts, also known as industrial trucks, which are small- to midsize material-handling vehicles used to lift and carry heavy loads from one location to another. Forklifts are mainly used by construction, manufacturing and freight-handling industries. Growth in these industries underpins demand for forklifts produced by manufacturers. Revenue growth has been stunted overall because of suspended trade and industrial production activity amid the COVID-19 pandemic. Many companies suspended their operations temporarily because of government restrictions. Still, restrictions have substantially eased, enabling activity within the industrial production sector to resume. Still, industry revenue has been shrinking at a CAGR of 0.6% through the end of 2024 to reach $12.9 billion, including an expected dip of 0.7% in 2024 alone.",

Booming utility construction helped to shore up demand for forklifts used in construction. Increased demand from wholesalers and retailers catering to the increased needs of e-commerce sales helped drive demand for materials handling equipment used in storage, transportation and logistics. However, investment in new machinery and equipment was put on hold or canceled during the COVID-19 pandemic due to social distancing measures, hindering demand from downstream markets and draining revenue."

Still, exports to USMCA trade partners have swelled beyond pre-pandemic levels, accounting for an expected combined 69.6% of all forklift exports. Trade frictions between the United States and China have resulted in exports falling.
