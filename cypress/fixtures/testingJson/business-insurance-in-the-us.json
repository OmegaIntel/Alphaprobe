These events include car accidents, natural disasters or machinery issues. Business insurance is primarily for businesses that want to pool several different commercial-related insurance policies together, which results in a lower premium price for such packages. Accordingly, companies emphasize potential risk exposure when pricing business insurance policies, with insurance policy prices falling during price-cutting cycles or softening and rising during price-raising or hardening cycles.",
