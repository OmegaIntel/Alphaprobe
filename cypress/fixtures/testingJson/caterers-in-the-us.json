    "executive_summary": "The Caterers industry has been grappling with the double effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and plummeting marriage rates. Before the pandemic, a surge in downstream consumer expenditures and booming corporate profit spurred demand for business-to-consumer events. Yet, this was insufficient to neutralize the detrimental impact of the dwindling marriage rates. To mitigate these hindrances, caterers innovated by launching new menu options and offering diverse services.",

This comes to a halt when business closures occur or profit plunges. Further, the shift to remote work has further dampened this demand. Corporate marketing budgets play a significant role; companies with larger marketing budgets host more promotional events, directly benefiting the business-to-business (B2B) catering sector. On the other hand, the earnings of the business-to-consumer (B2C) catering segment rely more on general consumer behavior. Higher levels of employment and rising disposable income can result in increased attendance at events such as electronics or car shows, boosting the industry's revenue."

However, with fewer households in the high-income bracket (earning above $100,000), there's been a decline in consumer spending on luxuries such as catering services for parties and private functions, reducing industry revenue. Unmarried cohabitation is seeing a significant increase, progressively becoming a plausible alternative to conventional marriages. Collectively, since the number of high-income earners seeing a decrease, the demand for wedding catering services has experienced a notable decline. This indicates a shift in societal and financial norms as noteworthy expenses associated with traditional weddings are being questioned or altogether dismissed."

This aligns with a broader societal shift towards healthier living and dietary consciousness, leading caterers to alter their offerings accordingly. The statistics point to a significant spike in people opting for a plant-based diet, inducing caterers to factor this on their menus to entice vegan or vegetarian guests. Another critical trend is catering to dietary restrictions, specifically lactose intolerance. In response to growing demand, caterers are adopting dairy-free substitutes such as oats, almonds, and cashew milk. These alternatives provide health benefits and flavors similar to traditional dairy milk while ensuring guests' dietary needs are met without compromising the overall catering experience."

The sudden drop in demand directly impacted the industry's bottom line. The profitability of this business is highly sensitive to food prices, which are known for their volatility. The recent inflationary trend has resulted in skyrocketing food costs, leading to higher expenses for caterers. However, caterers have mitigated some of these risks by buying food in larger quantities and practicing portion control during meal preparation. The industry has also rapidly adapted to these challenges by streamlining supply chains, which helps reduce their exposure to food price fluctuations."
