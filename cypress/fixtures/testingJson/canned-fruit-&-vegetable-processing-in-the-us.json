    "executive_summary": "The Canned Fruit and Vegetable Processing industry often performs countercyclically to the US economy, benefiting it in times of economic uncertainty. During periods of growth, consumers shy away from canned fruit and vegetable products as higher levels of disposable income enable them to trade up to pricier and fresher products. The perception that canned and processed food is less nutritious than fresh and unprocessed food has been a substantial inhibitor of industry expansion in recent years, especially as health consciousness rises. Producers have responded by diversifying product lines to include canned goods with zero added sugars, low-sodium or organic ingredients. Still, there is little opportunity for product innovation in canned fruit and vegetable processing, leaving companies to compete on price and quality.",

Wholesale grocers such as Costco and Sam's Club satisfied this shift in consumer preferences and drove consumers to stock up on canned food. Recent inflationary pressures exacerbated the bulk-food trend and boosted sales of canned fruit and vegetable products."

According to a 2021 survey by the International Food Information Council, 29.0% of consumers are less likely to purchase a food or beverage if it is processed, while 23.0% reported that it depends on the type of food. Foods high in protein are the most popular processed foods to buy."

More organic movements abroad will present an opportunity for exports. Emerging economies, such as India, are promoting organic farming, which will leave room for domestic companies to supplement organic canned goods during low yields."

The advantages of an organic label will differ by product segment. Organic produce isn't expected to succeed as much as organic soups, sauces, jams and pickles, all of which have fewer healthier substitutes. Organic food sales grew to $57.5 billion in 2021, according to the Organic Trade Association, outpacing many conventional grocery foods. As this trend continues, organic food will continue to provide room for growth in coming years."

This uncertain operating environment will impact processors' ability to earn consistent margins. Fruit and vegetable processors will look to wages to as a means of cutting costs. Due to the Ukraine-Russia war, the price of fertilizer is expected to remain elevated in the period as Russia remains one of the largest producers of fertilizer, which complicates prices in the period as many countries, including the US, have imposed sanctions on the country. The elevated cost of fertilizer, while possibly passed along to consumers in the form of higher prices, could also impact profit for canned fruit and vegetable processors in the coming years."
