    "executive_summary": "Over the past five years, the Pizza Restaurant Franchises industry has experienced steady growth attributable to increasing consumer sentiment and consumer spending. Consumer spending has improved, resulting in increased expenditure on food away from home, including at pizza franchises. The industry has even grown faster than the broader Pizza Restaurants industry as the number of establishments operated under a franchise agreement has grown substantially. Many pizza franchisors have sold their company-owned locations to franchisees, expanding the number of franchised locations. However, like the broader Pizza Restaurants industry, pizza franchises have experienced increased competition from other pizza restaurants and the broader food service sector. In 2020, industry revenue benefited from the work-from-home arrangements stemming from the COVID-19 pandemic. Nonetheless, pizza franchises were required to operate with delivery and take-out services only. As a result, industry revenue has increased an annualized 2.3% to $45.0 billion over the past five years, including 0.7% growth in 2023 alone. Nonetheless, profit has decreased over the past five years due to increased pricing competition and rising input costs.",
