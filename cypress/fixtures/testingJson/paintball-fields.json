    "executive_summary": "Demand for the Paintball Fields industry has declined over the five years to 2021. Consumer interest in paintball as both a sport and hobby has been waning in recent years, since a substantial peak in 2016. Moreover, the substantial upfront and continual costs associated with paintball equipment purchases has deterred consumers from engaging in the activity. These trends have contributed to consistent revenue decline for much of the five-year period and have been amplified by the COVID-19 (coronavirus) pandemic. Overall, total revenue has decreased at an annualized rate of 0.3% to $1.3 billion over the five years to 2021.",
