Major agricultural corporations are the industry's primary downstream customers, supplemented by retailers and nonresidential building construction. Key performance indicators closely tied to the agricultural market, like the agricultural price index, domestic corn production and the oil and natural gas index, significantly influence the growth of the industry. Industry revenue has increased at a CAGR of 5.7% to $155.1 billion over the five years to 2024, including an increase of 4.6% in 2024 alone.",
