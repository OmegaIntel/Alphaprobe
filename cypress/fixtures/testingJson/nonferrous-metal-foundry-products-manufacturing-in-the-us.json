    "executive_summary": "The Nonferrous Metal Foundry Products Manufacturing industry produces cast metal components used as semi-finished goods to produce many household and industrial products. As lighter alternatives to iron and steel, nonferrous metal castings can replace their ferrous counterparts in applications in which weight is essential, such as in motor vehicle and aircraft manufacturing. Accordingly, automotive and aerospace-related industries are the largest markets for foundry products and hold authority over the health of metal foundries. The COVID-19 pandemic caused global travel and consumer spending to fall abruptly in 2020. Effects from the pandemic, including global supply-chain shortages and suppressed purchases from downstream manufacturing, significantly hurt revenue generation for nonferrous metal foundries. Revenue has decreased at a CAGR of 3.7% to $12.2 billion through the end of 2024, including a boost of 0.2% in 2023 alone.",
