Companies have increasingly shifted to aluminum to produce lighter, more fuel-efficient bodies. Steel prices also rose more than 110.0% during the pandemic, encouraging automakers to substitute with aluminum. Semiconductor shortages have also led to elevated purchase costs. Automakers use semiconductors for most electronic systems, like radios, GPS, entertainment systems, and driver assistance. These shortages have led to skyrocketing car prices in recent years."
