    "executive_summary": "Online baby product sales retailers have benefited from rising incomes, as increasingly tech-savvy first-time parents can turn to online retailers to create baby registries, furnish nurseries and conveniently order everyday items. COVID-19's sudden shutdown of brick-and-mortar stores accelerated the rise of the digital economy, including online baby product retailers. Consumer behaviors quickly changed following COVID-19, especially for expectant families and first-time parents caring for newborns, who turned to online retailers in greater numbers and frequency. As the effects of COVID-19 faded, the industry returned to more stable growth rates, in line with normal demand. In all, revenue is expected to increase at a CAGR of 11.5% over the past five years and is expected to total $12.8 billion in 2024, when revenue will increase an estimated 2.3%.",
