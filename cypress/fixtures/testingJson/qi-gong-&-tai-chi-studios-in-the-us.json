    "executive_summary": "The revenue performance of qi gong and tai chi studios over the last five years has been influenced by a boost in per capita disposable income and total recreation expenditure. This influence has led to growth in industry revenue at an estimated CAGR of 2.4% through the end of 2024. However, the current year's revenue will drop at an expected 0.9% in 2024, at which point revenue will be an estimated $391.8 million. In spite of this slight downturn, the profit of qi gong and tai chi studios has remained relatively stable over the last five years. From reaching a peak of 12.8% in 2019, it has modestly inched down to 12.5% in 2024. The industry's resilience and stability are, thus, highlighted by its profit, which, despite economic fluctuations and minor downtrends, have managed to hold steady. Looking to the next five years' projections, qi gong and tai chi industry is bound for continued growth, albeit slightly dropping its pace. The forecasted CAGR for the upcoming five-year period through to 2029 is 2.1%. The growth indicators for this period suggest enhanced potential, with expansion factors including an expansion in the population of adults aged 20 to 64, a boost in the consumer confidence index and more total recreation expenditure. Other growth contributors are identified as increased time spent on leisure and sports, bolstered per capita disposable income and a drop in the national unemployment rate.",

            "current_performance_point_description": "The global pandemic impacted the industry since most establishments were forced to close temporarily because of strict lockdown measures that required non-essential businesses, including qi gong and tai chi studios, to close to protect public health. The industry saw a very marginal increase in revenue growth amidst the crisis, specifically in 2020, likely stemming from the decision of some studios to partake in virtual classes amid stay-at-home orders. Following the relatively gloomy period of 2020, qi gong and tai chi studios saw improvement in the performance of qi gong and tai chi studios for the subsequent years in the current period."

These alternatives often come in the form of pilates and yoga classes, with flexible memberships that are particularly appealing to budget-minded customers. Some consumers also prefer fitness classes offered by gyms over those at qi gong and tai chi studios. Although the industry continues to grow, swelling competition has exerted further pressure on profit, leading it to inch down to 12.5% of revenue in 2024."

        "Future projections indicate continued albeit slower growth over the next five years, driven by demographic trends, consumer confidence and increased leisure time. Therefore, the overall outlook for the industry remains positive with an expected upward trajectory in revenue.",
        "Regulations for qi gong and tai chi studios vary based on location and are often connected to broader fitness industry standards. These may involve safety, accessibility, instructor certification and business licensing.",
        "Associations like the National Qigong Association and the Tai Chi Foundation provide assistance to qi gong and tai chi studios through educational resources, networking opportunities and certification programs. Also, organizations like the American Tai Chi and Qigong Association offer instructor listings, insurance benefits and professional development. In some cases, studios may also qualify for local government grants or incentives to support health and wellness.",
        "The expansion in remote qi gong and tai chi classes is driven by boosted accessibility, affordability and convenience, suggesting substantial growth potential. Despite the trend, in-person training currently dominates, while high-cost individual sessions denote a niche market for customized services.",
        "Interest in qi gong and tai chi is rising among younger people due to wellness trends and alternative healing methods. Middle-aged groups prefer these low-impact activities, whereas they are most popular with senior citizens for their health benefits and social opportunities.",
        "Qi gong and tai chi studios endure considerable competition from various fitness and wellness alternatives like yoga, pilates and meditation centers. This competition creates a continuous pressure to innovate and remain up-to-date with market trends while still maintaining the traditional principles that define their practice. The popularity of personal training and home fitness equipment presents additional competition. However, qi gong and tai chi studios can still differentiate themselves through their focus on ancient Eastern healing practices, holistic health, mental wellness and individualized, non-competitive environments.",
        "The cost of renting studios for qi gong and tai chi has shown remarkable steadiness over the five years to 2024, despite operators' preference for leasing high-traffic areas for customer convenience.",
        "The costs are mostly due to commercial space rentals rather than equipment. Wage costs have been the highest expense for qi gong and tai chi studios through the end of 2024 due to their reliance on skilled instructors. Balancing wages and maintaining high-quality instructors for profit are the ongoing challenges for these studios in the wellness and fitness market."
