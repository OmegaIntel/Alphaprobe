    "executive_summary": "Audio and visual equipment have many applications spanning many downstream markets. The rental market depends on the economy's health and borrowing rates. The pandemic caused many major markets like entertainment and commercial businesses to shut down, leading to a detraction in revenue. Even so, the uptick in residential construction and the reopening some industrial markets offered a glimmer of hope. Equipment rental and leasing contractors promptly recovered as the economy reopened and business activity resumed. Overall revenue is expected to climb at a CAGR of 2.5% to $10.6 billion through the end of 2024, including a 1.0% uptick in 2024 alone.",

Even so, residential construction and hospitals remained open, offering a slight cushion for renters. Low-interest rates spurred rapid housing construction. Construction sites use audio-visual equipment to ensure everything runs smoothly. Hospitals remained open as many patients were rushed in from catching the virus or getting vaccinated."

Both markets suffered significantly amid the pandemic and were forced to shut down to prevent the spread of the virus. As the economy recovered, restaurants, bars and live entertainment venues opened up, causing the need for audio and visual equipment to swell up. Many stadiums rented equipment for live sports and concerts to enhance ticketholders' viewing and listening experience. Smaller theaters reopened and many of these venues prefer to rent equipment as the cost of buying continues to spike."

Even so, inflationary concerns caused interest rates to spike as the cost of borrowing swelled. This caused many residential construction builders to cut or hold off on projects, weakening the need for audio-visual equipment on building sites. As inflationary concerns cool down and interest rates creep downward, downstream markets will allocate more funds to audio and visual equipment. Many establishments will have obsolete equipment and seek new technologically advanced equipment to take its place."

Many of these businesses can get by with older models and prefer to buy used to save money, all while having permanent access to the equipment."

While equipment prices have continued to swell, companies can markup rental prices to adjust for this and prevent fall-offs in profit. Some companies offer discounts for longer-term rental contracts or bulk orders. Many rental companies can also make customers liable for damages, reducing risk on sensitive equipment."
