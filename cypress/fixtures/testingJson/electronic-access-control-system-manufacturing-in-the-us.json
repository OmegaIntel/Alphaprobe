The industry has recently been affected by volatile downstream markets, the effects of import penetration, and the outbreak of the pandemic. As a result, industry revenue has been declining at an annualized rate of 4.4% over the past five years and is expected to reach $3.7 billion in 2023, although this conceals significant year-to-year volatility. Industry profit has similarly fallen due to lower demand and high competition from foreign manufacturers, with profitability overall waning to 5.6%. Industry revenue is poised to undergo course correction in 2023, inclining 1.2% as macroeconomic conditions improve.",
