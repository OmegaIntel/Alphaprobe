    "executive_summary": "The meat jerky industry has proven resilient despite COVID-19 pressures, with revenue growth in 2020 driven by e-commerce and retail partnerships. Rising meat prices boosted revenue, but falling disposable income in 2022 forced producers to absorb costs, cutting profit. Overall industry revenue grew at a 1.7% CAGR over the past five years and is expected to reach $982.9 million in 2024. Jerky benefits from demand for protein snacks, but concerns about red meat prompted launches of plant-based and artisanal products. While disposable income will climb through 2029, falling meat prices will pressure production. Revenue is forecast to dip at a 0.2% CAGR over the next five years to $974.5 million.",
