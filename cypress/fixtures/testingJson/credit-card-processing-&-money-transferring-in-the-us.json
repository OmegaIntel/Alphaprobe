    "executive_summary": "The Credit Card Processing and Money Transferring industry offers financial transaction processing, reserve and clearinghouse services. The industry generates its revenue through processing and transaction fees via credit and debit card purchases. The value of credit card transactions determines the fees processors collect from merchants. Rising consumer spending over most of the past five years has largely supported growth. More notably, processors have reaped the benefits of the large-scale application of electronic payment technology and growing e-commerce during the five-year period. The adoption of electronic payments was accelerated by the coronavirus, which shifted consumers toward online shopping platforms following lockdown measures.",
