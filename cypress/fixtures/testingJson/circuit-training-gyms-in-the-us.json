    "executive_summary": "Circuit training gyms experienced significant shifts over the five years to 2024. The industry consists of operators that manage fitness and recreational sports facilities. These facilities feature general exercise, conditioning or recreational activities in the circuit format. Circuit training involves moving through stations focusing on different muscle groups with minimal rest in between. Before the onset of COVID-19, the industry experienced robust growth because of the rising popularity of circuit training and increasing health consciousness. COVID-19 delivered a harsh blow in 2020. Lockdowns, social distancing and the rise of online fitness programs led to a drastic decline in revenue. Despite the slump in 2020, signs of recovery have emerged as gym attendance showed renewed traction.",
