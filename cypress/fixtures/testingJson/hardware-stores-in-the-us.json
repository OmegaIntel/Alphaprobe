A surge in do-it-yourself (DIY) projects has increased traffic to hardware stores as consumers seek tools and supplies for home projects. Economic growth and a robust real estate market have also given the sector a boost, fueling demand for everything from basic building supplies to high-end tools. However, increased competition from large retail chains and the rise of e-commerce have presented challenges.",
