    "executive_summary": "Figures have been adjusted for inflation and are presented in 2022 currency. Operators in the Eyeglasses Frames Manufacturing industry produce eyeglasses frames using plastics, metals, and other materials, as well as parts used in eyeglasses. Consumers have increased expenditure on frames over the five years to 2022 as a result of increased per capita disposable income and federal funding for Medicare and Medicaid. However, operators have experienced continued pressure from external competition, primarily imports, which account for almost half of domestic demand in 2022. While international trade was halted due to the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, an appreciating US dollar during the period has benefited foreign manufacturers and has hindered exports. Overall, industry revenue is expected to increase at an annualized rate of 0.2% to $1.9 billion over the five years to 2022, including an increase of 1.5% in 2022 alone.",
