    "executive_summary": "The Concrete Pipe Manufacturing industry has encountered harsh and inconsistent operating conditions over the past five years, causing revenue to fluctuate significantly. Manufacturers make concrete pipes, which are used in a wide variety of construction projects, both residential and nonresidential. Industry pipes are frequently used for sewage and storm drains; industry revenue is highly dependent on utilities construction and public infrastructure investment. Over the past five years, the value of utility construction has swung inconsistently, while the value of other nonresidential construction dropped overall; both were exacerbated by COVID-19, causing industry revenue to fall in 2020.",
