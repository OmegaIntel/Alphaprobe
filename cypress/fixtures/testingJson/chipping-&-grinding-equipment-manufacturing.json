These products are mainly employed by the forestry sector and recycling facilities to produce wood-based products for paper manufacturing, agricultural purposes, landscaping and energy sources. This industry has experienced volatile conditions over the five years to 2021. The past five years have been characterized by challenging international trade conditions, a sharp decline and a surge in residential construction as a result of the global outbreak of COVID-19 (coronavirus). Overall, industry revenue is expected to increase an annualized 1.7% to reach an estimated $309.5 million, with the industry declining 7.1% in 2021 alone as residential construction demand spikes.",

Since industry products tend to be large-scale capital investments, consumers usually finance machinery that can run into the hundreds of thousands of dollars. However, historically low interest rates over the five years to 2021 have aided downstream industries' investment."
