The Premium Steak Restaurants industry has fared relatively well most of the past five years, following similarly positive trends in the domestic economy. The industry is characterized by high-end dining establishments, with average customer checks totaling $50.00 or more. As a result, growth in per capita disposable income, consumer confidence and spending and the prevalence of households earning more than $100,000 in annual income has benefited the industry, enabling consumers to opt for premium steak establishments for dining experiences.",

Large multinational corporations relying heavily on a sales force often continue such expenditures, as closing specific contracts outweigh one-time costs. In 2020, a decline in corporate profit forced businesses to cut back on discretionary expenses, such as those spent on premium steak restaurants, thus weighing on industry revenue dramatically."

This discrepancy between price and quantity underlines the nature of fine-dining, such as premium steakhouses, that aim to offer high-quality, rare and intricate dishes in exchange for premium prices. This dynamic creates natural discrimination against consumers of low-income status due to affordability, thus explaining the industry's reliance on high-income households."
