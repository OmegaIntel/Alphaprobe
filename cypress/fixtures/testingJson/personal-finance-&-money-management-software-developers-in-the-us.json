Finance has continued to grow by integrating with financial institutions, offering highly personalized advice, and negotiating with companies to reduce bills. While the greater economy experienced a temporary setback during COVID, financial software revenue grew, driven by people rushing to create budgets and get finances in order. Financial software revenue has grown at a CAGR of 2.3% to $7.6 billion in 2024, including an increase of 1.6% in that year alone. Meanwhile, profit has fallen due to advances in product offerings by the largest technology companies and a growing number of competitors offering advice.",
