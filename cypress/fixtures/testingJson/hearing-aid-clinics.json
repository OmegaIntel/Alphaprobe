    "executive_summary": "The Hearing Aid Clinics industry has grown over much of the five years to 2022 due to beneficial demographic trends and ultimately, a strong economy. Rising disposable income has been key to the industry's growth over the past five years. Hearing aids are relatively expensive, with a custom-fit pair ranging between $3,000 and $4,000, while some of the industry's high-end pairs cost more than $7,000. Since Medicare, the government-funded health insurance program that provides coverage for adults over the age of 65, does not cover hearing aids, out-of-pocket payments for industry products have remained important. However, the COVID-19 (coronavirus) pandemic undermined industry growth in 2020, as millions of Americans lost access to health insurance and consumers have delayed nonessential healthcare services. Since 2021, industry revenue has rebounded as the pandemic has abated and the economy has rebounded, with especially strong growth in the labor market and therefore, rising insurance coverage. As a result, industry revenue has increased an annualized rate of 0.8% to $2.5 billion over the five years to 2022. IBISWorld expects industry revenue to decline 4.1% in 2022 alone.",

As people age, the structure of the inner ear changes and can often hinder blood flow, resulting in hearing loss."
