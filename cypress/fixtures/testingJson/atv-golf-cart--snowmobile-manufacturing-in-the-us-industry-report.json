    "executive_summary": "ATV, golf cart and snowmobile manufacturers have faced notable volatility through the current period. Since these products are highly discretionary, severe economic uncertainty contributed to sharp declines and weak profit. In particular, plummeting consumer confidence, volatile inflation and climbing interest rates curtailed growth. Even so, manufacturers capitalized on lockdown restrictions and stimulus checks to create massive growth opportunities in 2021. Regardless, revenue has contracted at an expected CAGR of 1.1% to $10.0 billion through the current period, despite a 0.1% jump in 2024, where profit reached 3.4%. Manufacturers also dealt with soaring input costs and supply chain disruptions.",
