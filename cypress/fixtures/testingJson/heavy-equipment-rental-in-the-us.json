The industry's financial performance is subject to trends and activity in an array of downstream markets, including air, sea and rail transportation; highway, street and bridge construction; and oil exploration and drilling. In the years to 2023, activity in downstream markets, particularly air and rail transportation, has supported revenue, but a downturn in 2020 disrupted this growth. The COVID-19 outbreak caused a contraction in revenue, driven by a decline in industrial activity. Activity largely resumed in 2021, but slowed significantly in 2023. Revenue fell overall at a CAGR of 0.6% through the end of 2023 to $47.6 billion, including a decline of 3.5% in 2023.",
