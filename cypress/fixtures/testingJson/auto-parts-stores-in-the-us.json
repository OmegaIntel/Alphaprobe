            "question": "Does your company specialize in marketing to households or downstream businesses?",
            "answer": "Most operators serve an array of downstream markets, including households, repair shops and other downstream retailers. In 2023, households are expected to account for 66.8% of industry revenue, while repair shops are expected to account for 22.8% and other businesses are expected to account for 10.4%."
        },
        {
            "question": "How has the recent economic recovery affected demand for auto parts?",
            "answer": "High disposable incomes combined with stay-at-home orders and general concern about being in public has led to massive increases in sales of automotive parts for DIY applications. Retaining these customers could be a significant opportunity."
        },
        {
            "question": "How have rising input prices and declining consumer confidence amid the pandemic affected your company's ability to strategically price products to optimize returns?",
            "answer": "When input costs increase, parts manufactures often times pass on these rising costs to downstream consumers, such as auto parts retailers. Consequently, higher input costs at the manufacturing level often times causes the price of these parts at the retail level to rise."
        },
        {
            "question": "In an industry experiencing rising market share concentration, have you explored acquisition opportunities to expand your market share and lower operational costs?",
            "answer": "Companies are always looking to grow operations through acquisitions. Larger companies acquire smaller, less profitable auto parts stores in order to expand their market presence and product portfolios. The industry's largest players grew to such status through a combination of organic growth and aggressive acquisition activity."
        },
        {
            "question": "How has the implementation of point-of-sales (POS) systems enabled your company to track stock levels and ensure popular items remain stocked? Have you passed any of these tracking benefits on to customer-visible systems?",
            "answer": "Companies typically use POS systems in order to track inventory quickly and efficiently. Companies also provide product inventory online in many cases. POS systems enable companies to better manage their inventories, resulting in higher customer satisfaction, as popular items are kept stocked, and stable profit margins, as operators are not spending money on superfluous items. Customers now expect relatively accurate inventory counts on e-commerce platforms."
        },
        {
            "question": "Have you implemented any automation processes in an attempt to reduce wage costs?",
            "answer": "Auto part stores often times invest in POS systems to lessen the need for employees and reduce wage costs. Moreover, many operators have installed self-check-out systems, slightly reducing employment needs. However, due to high internal and external competition, many operators have experienced rising wage costs and highly-knowledgeable employees have become imperative and command higher wages."
        },
        {
            "question": "Have increased regulations resulting from the coronavirus pandemic hindered profit growth for your business?",
            "answer": "Operators have been exposed to rising regulations amid the pandemic, mostly pertaining to the health and safety of employees and customers and have included the purchase of PPE for employees and retrofitting establishments to follow social distancing guidelines. Due to these changes, many operators experienced rising purchase costs, eating away at profit."
        },
        {
            "question": "How does your company ensure it is staying abreast of changing regulations pertaining to the operation of auto parts stores?",
            "answer": "Operators have several outlets for staying aware of changing regulations, including the Automotive Parts and Accessories Association and the Automotive Service Industry Association. Such industry associations provide members with information regarding changing regulation and policies and generally provide additional information on operational activities, along with lobbying on behalf of industry operators."
        },
        {
            "question": "As many companies introduce financing options for all purchases through third-party applications, has your company explored offering financing options to customers?",
            "answer": "Parts and accessories are not typically as expensive as a new or used vehicle and therefore, financing is not necessary. Accessories are often the least expensive and most discretionary, while auto parts are purchased more on a as need basis."
        },
        {
            "question": "How have supply chain disruptions amid the pandemic affected your company's profit? Are there any disruptions still impacting your business?",
            "answer": "Operators rely on a slew of upstream manufacturers and distributors for their products. Amid the pandemic, many upstream suppliers experienced manufacturing disruptions or issues with distribution, resulting in relatively scarcity in certain products, which drove purchasing prices up. Due to the economic downturn, consumers became increasingly uncertain regarding their financial status."
        },
        {
            "question": "How do you ensure that your delivery system is cost-effective? Does your company use software-as-a-service applications? Have you been able to reduce operational costs with effective distribution systems?",
            "answer": "National auto parts chains require distribution networks to keep stores well stocked. Efficient distribution systems can be a significant comparative advantage. Despite more efficient distribution systems, many operators experienced rising purchase costs over the past five years, resulting in declining profit."
        },
        {
            "question": "How do you ensure your employees are highly-skilled and trained and able to answer customers questions about various automotive issues? Do you offer educational services for your employees?",
            "answer": "Hiring highly-knowledgeable employees is critical for successful operators, as industry establishments carry a wide variety of products for various downstream uses.

            "answer": "Having a loyal customer base increases profitability by creating a consistent revenue base and reducing the need for advertisement. Some national operators offer rewards programs, which entice repeat visits, as customers may receive discounts or special pricing on select services. Operators also ensure customer loyalty by providing top-notch service, keeping stock of popular items and ensuring customers are served quickly and efficiently."

        {
            "question": "How does the age of the vehicle fleet influence demand for your business's services? Do customers still frequent your establishment when they have a new vehicle?",
            "answer": "A rise in the average age of the vehicle fleet represents an opportunity for industry operators, as older vehicles generally require more regular work and auto parts. In 2023, the average age of the vehicle fleet is expected to rise 0.5%, representing an increase in the potential customer pool for operators."
        },
        {
            "question": "Do you expect major changes in demand as a result of rising disposable income levels? When disposable income rises but other economic factors are declining, how does demand for your business fluctuate?",
            "answer": "Growth in disposable income may decrease industry demand, as consumers are able to purchase new automobiles instead of spending money on auto parts. Conversely, increased disposable income enables other individuals that otherwise would not have been able to do so to purchase auto parts. In 2023, disposable income is expected to grow 0.2%."
        },
        {
            "question": "How has the rise in e-commerce auto parts sales affected demand for your brick-and-mortar business? Have you experienced mounting competition from e-commerce platforms amid the pandemic? How have you added value to in-person or e-commerce systems?",
            "answer": "E-commerce platforms represent a significant form of competition for industry operators, as consumers have increasingly opted to purchase online following research rather than purchase in-person. Amid the coronavirus pandemic and social distancing policies, demand for e-commerce increased substantially to the detriment of industry operators."
