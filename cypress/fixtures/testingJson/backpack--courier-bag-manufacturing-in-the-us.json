    "executive_summary": "Backpack and courier bag manufacturers make backpacks, outdoor packs and courier bags. These products are used for school, work, sports and outdoor activities. Operators benefited in the years immediately preceding the pandemic, as massive wage growth and high incomes boosted spending on the industry's products. COVID-19 led to school closures, which reduced demand for school bags, causing revenue to creep downward in 2020. As consumers became more concerned about viruses, they sought outdoor activities that involved little human interaction, such as hiking. Surging demand for outdoor activities increased spending on technical packs, significantly contributing to revenue growth. Inflation has constrained households' budgets in recent years, causing consumers to prioritize necessities over wants, so spending on outdoor packs and fancy courier bags has declined, disrupting manufacturers' performance.",

Backpacks and courier bags are often used for discretionary activities, so demand for the industry's products surged when consumers had lots of extra income, aiding the industry."

Since students weren't physically traveling to school, demand for backpacks declined, causing revenue for the industry to fall slightly in 2020. As restrictions were lifted in 2021, schools began operating exclusively in-person again, increasing the need for backpacks and boosting revenue."

Since many individuals flocked to the countryside during the pandemic, they wanted to hike and do other outdoor activities involving little human interaction. Demand for technical packs has skyrocketed because of more spending on outdoor activities, spurring revenue growth during the current period."

As more people become less active, demand for outdoor activities will plunge. Less interest in outdoor activities will cause sales for sporting goods stores to fall, reducing downstream demand for manufacturers and disrupting the industry."

As the US dollar depreciates, consumers in other countries will find domestically produced goods less expensive, enabling US-based companies to export their products. Since exporting goods will be easier, operators can get revenue from consumers abroad that prefer physical activity."
