While higher educational institutions have faced rising skepticism amid high student debt, for-profit universities' more affordable price tags helped them avoid more significant enrollment declines. Competition from vocational schools and other affordable alternatives pressured the industry's pricing power, but robust tuition hikes have kept revenue on a steady trajectory upward in the pandemic's aftermath. Industry revenue has ultimately swelled at a CAGR of 0.2% to an estimated $13.9 billion over the five years through 2024.",

Proponents of student debt cancellation point to the decision's potential to bring back students who didn't complete their degrees.

Many recent graduates are entering the workforce straightaway to avoid expensive tuition. Still, the industry has remained attractive to many because of its status as a cheaper option than some substitutes. Rising tuition costs at traditional four-year institutions have encouraged many recent high school graduates to enroll in relatively affordable online courses at for-profit schools. Still, for-profit universities are more expensive than other external competitors, like vocational schools and apprenticeship programs.
