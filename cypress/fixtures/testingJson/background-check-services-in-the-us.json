    "executive_summary": "Background check providers have enjoyed growth over the current period. The robust demand for background check services, which spans a variety of corporate clients and smaller businesses, creates a consistent demand niche for operators. Although operators continue to enjoy robust demand, shaly economic conditions and volatility in the overall labor market has affected their rate of growth. The outbreak of the pandemic and rising interest rates hindered the labor market in 2020 and 2023. Overall, revenue grew at a CAGR of 2.8% to an estimated $4.5 billion over the past five years, including an anticipated 2.1% decline in 2024.",

            "current_performance_point_description": "Since background check service providers are engaged in ensuring candidate validity, the effects of changing regulations play a significant role in affecting core revenue streams. Many states have begin implementing various Clean Slate Laws, which enable employment candidates to have niche criminal records be removed from consideration. Evolving rules surrounding cannabis consumption have also accelerated background check providers' appeal, with states like Minnesota easing restrictions on testing for cannabis use. Since most regulatory focus is placed on a state and local level, background check providers with excellent legal insights and strong understanding of employment laws will be better equipped in adapting to new regulatory changes."

The number of background check providers has fallen considerably over the current period. Competition for smaller background check providers has increased, leading many to cease operations. Since smaller background check providers typically require more employees and account for more wages, these costs have fallen over the current period amid the continued exodus of these companies. Falling wage costs strengthened profit as automated systems have replaced the need for a large workforce. Larger companies producing background checks in bulk also reduced the costs of providing them, boosting profit."

The companies used the proceeds of the initial public offering to repay their debt, unwind certain interest rate swaps and invest in technologies to improve operational efficiencies. Larger companies' investments in automated data collection and report generation infrastructure have paid dividends in differentiating themselves from smaller background check providers as they have increasingly attracted clients. As the importance of the quality of sources and price-based competition expanded, these companies strengthened their market share as they could produce high-quality background checks in bulk while keeping prices low."

Tech companies have laid off many human resource workers and financial services companies have laid off some of their back-office staff. Financial services companies laying off employees has hurt background check providers as these companies provide a consistent source of business through continuous background check services because of the high-risk nature of services. While background check providers have faced declines from companies, other industries have looked to take advantage of the influx in available tech workers, offsetting losses."

Inflationary pressures will continue to stress wages and create an imbalance in the labor market early over the outlook period, as recessionary concerns create lower labor demand and fewer job openings. As the effects of the great resignation gradually subside, the labor force participation rate will increase, benefitting background check providers. As tech and finance companies ramp up rehiring after layoffs late over the current period, background check providers will enjoy a surge in growth, particularly as accelerating digitization will boost specialized background check providers."

Increasing security concerns will prevent smaller companies that can't implement data protection measures from beginning to operate and will continue to lead to smaller companies ceasing operations. Clients will be more selective about which background check provider they choose to ensure that they comply with evolving regulations. Background check service providers' services will become more complicated as regulations evolve. While regulations have changed at the federal level, changes have also occurred at state and local levels, making it more complicated to provide services to companies with employees in different states."

Competition from larger background check providers with increased automated data collection and report generation infrastructure will continue the trend of many small companies ceasing operations and disincentivizing new entrants, increasing consolidation. The number of small background check providers, which typically require more employees, ceasing operations will compound technological innovations, decreasing wages and expanding profit growth. Climbing competition from larger background check providers will disincentivize new background check providers from beginning to operate, as competing based on price and quality will be difficult."
