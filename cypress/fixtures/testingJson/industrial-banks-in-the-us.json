        },
        {
            "question": "Are your sales heavily dependent on the health of the US economy?",
            "answer": "The health of the US economy is extremely important to this industry, which relies on consumer access to credit and interest rates. The prime rate influences demand from large, credit-worthy borrowers. Demand for loans increases as the prime rate falls."
        },
        {
            "question": "Has your company been exposed to volatile prices over the past few years?",
            "answer": "Volatility in interest rates affects demand for loans, which affects demand for industrial banks."
        },
        {
            "question": "Has your company explored acquisition opportunities in locations with well-established infrastructure networks?",
            "answer": "Industrial banks are concentrated in the Rocky Mountains region due to the favorable regulatory environment. While larger banks have expanded, acquisitions remain limited in this industry due to its relatively small size, and consolidation has been driven more by the exit of less competitive players than anything else."
        },
        {
            "question": "Does your company use advanced software systems for operations?",
            "answer": "Automated predictive models and analysis improve the quality of risk assessments and loan terms. Online loan payment systems are another improvement to the industry. Other important areas of technological advancement include cybersecurity, digital banking and improved payments systems."
        },
        {
            "question": "Have you been able to reduce wage costs by automating operations over the past five years?",
            "answer": "Despite improvements in technology, the industry remains very labor intensive due to the need of human interaction for loan assessment. However, increasing use of artificial intelligence technologies will likely assist workers in making informed decisions regarding loan origination."
        },
        {
            "question": "How does your company stay compliant with industry regulations?",
            "answer": "The industry is reliant on capital adequacy requirements dictated by the FDIC. Higher capital adequacy requirements reduce the amount of loans that banks can issue. The industry is also highly regulated at the state level."
        },
        {
            "question": "How does your company earn revenue in the case of looser or simpler legislation?",
            "answer": "Industrial banks favor looser regulation because it allows for greater loan origination and interest income. Moreover, more industrial banks will enter the market if capital adequacy requirements are relaxed."
        },
        {
            "question": "How has volatility of interest rates affected profit margins over the past months?",
            "answer": "Volatile interest rates affect the interest spread on which industrial banks profit. They also affect the pricing of bank investments. Amid the coronavirus pandemic, interest rates have been held down by the Federal Reserve, limiting interest rate volatility."
        },
        {
            "question": "How does your company compensate for the dependence of cash flow on the economy?",
            "answer": "Industrial banks seek to offer products that are profitable throughout the year and throughout economic cycles. Examples of such products include credit cards. Consumers demand credit cards in emergencies, but also when the economy is growing and consumer spending increases. Amid the coronavirus pandemic, credit card income helped to limit declines in loan origination."
        },
        {
            "question": "How do you keep track of the company's expenditures? What costs can you cut back on?",
            "answer": "Superior financial management and debt management. Intermediaries need good interest rate, foreign exchange and operational risk management processes. Banks must maintain a rigorous and conservative risk management approach. Customer perception of creditworthiness is important. Amid the coronavirus pandemic, the Federal Reserve has held down interest rates, reducing the cost of bank borrowing, which constitutes the industry's largest expense. However, this has also placed downward pressure on interest rates charged to consumers and businesses."
        },
        {
            "question": "How do you monitor changing consumer preferences? What is your budget for innovating and creating new products?",
            "answer": "Banks must place a strong focus on their customers. Customers need accessibility, flexibility, convenience and choice. Successful banks will understand customer needs, develop product options and provide a range of delivery channels. For example, loans with different maturity structures and repayment plans that cater to different types of durable goods purchases, such as vehicle loans, are an avenue to cater to customer needs."
        },
        {
            "question": "Are you able to leverage economies of scale? How else can you reduce operating costs?",
            "answer": "Reducing unit costs is a key driver of profitability. Pressures for standardization, ease of use and cost efficiency are increasing. Specialization in processing may become an integral part of the banking system."
        },
        {
            "question": "How can you mitigate or prepare for the threat of increasing regulation?",
            "answer": "Any additional banking regulations could result in higher compliance costs, lower industry revenue and lower profit margin. Industrial banks experience high liquidity requirements, FDIC regulations and various state regulations as they are state-chartered entities."
        },
        {
            "question": "How closely do you follow the prime rate? What do you do to attract customers when interest rates are high?",
            "answer": "A rising prime rate helps industrial banks to earn more in interest revenue but generally slows loan demand in the long term. Amid the coronavirus pandemic, the Federal Reserve has held down interest rates on sovereign bonds, which has had the effect of keeping rates on less liquid or illiquid assets, such as bank loans, down as well."
        },
        {
            "question": "How closely does your business follow trends in aggregate household debt? How do you benefit from household debt?",
            "answer": "Industry interest revenue increases when consumers choose to borrow more money from banks and hold higher debt levels. Amid the coronavirus pandemic, aggregate household debt declined as households attempted to deleverage; however, moving forward, aggregate household debt is expected to increase in step with improvements in the overall economy."
