However, the changing economic landscape has burdened consumers with higher costs, painting a mixed picture of this industry's revenue in 2024.",

In response, the Federal Reserve has been enacting a policy of quantitative tightening while keeping interest rates high to tame rising prices and hopefully discourage more spending.
