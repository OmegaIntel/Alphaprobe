    "executive_summary": "Revenue for the Cigarette and Tobacco Products Wholesaling industry has shrunk over the past five years as wholesalers have contended with expanding regulatory and economic challenges and shifts in consumer preferences. The rapidly growing popularity of e-cigarettes has prompted wholesalers to expand their product portfolios, partially offsetting cigarette and tobacco product declines. Despite plummeting smoking rates, e-cigarette usage kept sales steady amid the pandemic. Over the past five years, revenue for the Cigarette and Tobacco Products Wholesaling industry has declined at a CAGR of 1.0% to reach an estimated $149.2 billion in 2023. Inflationary pressures will prompt an estimated 1.6% in revenue in 2023 alone.",

Flavored e-cigarettes have continued drawing younger, previously nonsmoking consumers in. Despite a substantial decline in the percentage of traditional cigarette smokers, cigarette and tobacco wholesalers saw a marginal increase in sales in 2020. Electronic vapor products are considered healthier than traditional tobacco products, boosting the popularity of the cigarette alternatives over the past five years."

Regulation surrounding traditional tobacco products has continued tightening, with federal and state excise taxes on tobacco increasing yearly for the past decade. Although federal excise taxes are remitted by tobacco manufacturers, wholesalers shoulder state excise taxes, forcing them to raise product prices. Federal antismoking campaigns, like The Real Cost, have weakened demand for traditional and electronic cigarettes through ads that highlight the adverse effects of smoking."
