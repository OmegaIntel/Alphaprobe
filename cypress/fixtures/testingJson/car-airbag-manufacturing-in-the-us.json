    "executive_summary": "Over the five years to 2022, revenue for the Car Airbag Manufacturing industry is expected to decline. Industry operators manufacture airbags for all types of automobiles, including passenger cars and light and heavy trucks. Due to being an intermediate good in the production of automobiles, industry revenue tends to ebb and flow with fluctuations in demand and production levels for new vehicles. As a result, several negative trends have hampered industry revenue, such as the temporary closure of automobile manufacturers and dealers in 2020 due to the COVID-19 (coronavirus) pandemic. Although automobile production has since resumed, supply chain constraints and semiconductor shortages have limited production levels in 2021 and 2022. Consequently, IBISWorld expects industry revenue to decline at an annualized rate of 3.6% to $3.7 billion over the past five years, despite an anticipated 4.5% rise in revenue in 2022 due to rising new car sales and rebounding automobile production levels.",

For instance, in 2019 domestic automobile production fell 9.8%, according to data from the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis and revenue fell 7.3% that year. In 2020 domestic automobile production levels declined another 22.7%, resulting in a decline in demand for car airbags from automobile manufacturers, which constitute the largest market for industry products. Moreover, new car sales are expected to decline at an annualized 0.6% over the five years to 2022."
