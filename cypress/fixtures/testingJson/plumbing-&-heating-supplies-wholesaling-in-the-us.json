These products are used in the construction, repair and remodeling of residential and nonresidential buildings. This industry relies on downstream demand for construction and renovation work, which have stayed relatively stable, except for a decline in 2020 because of COVID-19, enabling revenue to rebound in 2021 because of a low starting point. Revenue is expected to rise at a CAGR of 2.5% to $91.4 billion over the past five years, including an expected decrease of 0.6% in 2023 alone as pent-up demand is satisfied.",
