    "executive_summary": "The Heavy-Duty OTR Tire Manufacturing industry has had to contend with harsh operating conditions over the five years to 2021. The volatility in the price of rubber over the past five years has resulted in operators absorbing costs, reducing revenue and profit. Furthermore, volatility in demand from key downstream customers has plagued the industry. Additionally, the emergence of the COVID-19 (coronavirus) in 2020 has exacerbated these trends and has weakened macroeconomic conditions and reduced demand from downstream markets. However, due to mass immunization and a recovering economy, these trends reversed in 2021. Overall, industry revenue is expected to fall at an annualized rate of 2.2% to $4.4 billion over the five years to 2021. This includes an 8.1% rise in 2021 alone.",

An appreciation in the US dollar has intensified, escalating foreign competition and leading to a contraction in industry revenue. Additionally, revenue was hindered by the volatile conditions in downstream markets and natural rubber prices. Furthermore, in 2020 the emergence of COVID-19 (coronavirus) led to a decrease in revenue, as industry operators temporarily suspended production to contain the spread of the virus. However, in 2021, operations and international trade are expected to resume, following an economic recovery."

As a result, demand for OTR tires is largely determined by the performance of downstream industries that buy these types of vehicles and equipment. The construction, mining and agriculture sectors primarily purchase OTR tires."

In particular, the world price of rubber, which is the most important raw material used in tire manufacturing, has risen an annualized 6.5% over the five years to 2021. Volatility in commodity markets poses a problem for operators because a temporary rise in input prices forces industry manufacturers to absorb the costs rather than pass them on to customers."

Industry revenue is forecast to grow an annualized 2.9% to total $5.1 billion over the five years to 2026. This improvement in industry performance will likely be supported by strengthening demand for new tires in an expanding economy.
