    "executive_summary": "The Metalworking Machinery Manufacturing industry produces power-operated tools and machine accessories for finishing or shaping metal parts. Manufacturers develop products used by motor vehicle parts manufacturers. The pandemic significantly hurt metalwork manufacturing, as business closures and supply chain disruptions took a toll on manufacturers. Revenue has inched downward at a CAGR of 0.6% over the past five years and is expected to total $36.7 billion in 2024. Profit has dropped over the past five years because of volatile input costs. The industry is vulnerable to affordable imports and competition has undermined domestic manufacturers. Exports as a percentage of revenue have declined as the dollar's value has increased, bolstering competition from imports. Improving macroeconomic conditions will enable the industry to recover. Revenue is expected to expand at a CAGR of 1.2% to $38.9 billion over the five years to 2029.",
