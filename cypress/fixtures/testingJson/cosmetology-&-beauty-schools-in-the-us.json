Following the onset of the pandemic, the industry was quickly disrupted by school closures, dropouts and deferred enrollment amid stay-at-home measures. Admissions fell throughout 2020 amid overall economic uncertainty and skepticism surrounding cosmetology professions. Recovery from the pandemic spurred spending on personal care services as consumers released pent-up demand, though falling disposable income amid inflation limited the industry's recovery.",

Cosmetology school is necessary to make the transition smooth, and trade schools offer a faster way to enter a new profession than traditional universities. According to the American Association of Cosmetology Schools, people between 25 and 34 have a stronger interest in pursuing a career in cosmetology because the broader personal care services sector is less sensitive to economic fluctuations. This age group also generally has higher disposable income than younger students, so they're more willing and able to spend on training in cosmetology.",
