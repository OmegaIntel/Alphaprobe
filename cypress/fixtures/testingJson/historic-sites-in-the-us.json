Enterprises generally operate as nonprofit organizations and many are partnered with government organizations and receive public funding rather than gathering revenue from admission fees. Over the past five years, the industry has been experiencing volatile conditions due to inconsistent funding and high competition. Though operators have benefited from rises in disposable income rates early in the period, the COVID-19 pandemic exacerbated negative trends and resulted in drastic declines in visitor rates later in the period. Despite favorable conditions, industry revenue has been declining at an average annualized 0.5% over the past five years, reaching an estimated $1.5 billion in 2023, when revenue is expected to increase 6.0%.",

Due to social distancing guidelines, many industry establishments were forced to cease or limit operations for much of 2020, resulting in drastically diminished revenue that year. This was compounded by a sharp fall in consumer leisure travel amid safety concerns and rising economic uncertainty."

Per capita disposable income has increased marginally, and though the national unemployment rate spiked in 2020 due to layoffs and furloughs following the spread of the coronavirus and social distancing measures, it decreased substantially since. This caused revenue to take a steep decline that year."

Income growth in emerging economies will help further spur foreign travel to the United States, along with a projected decline in the value of the US dollar.",
        "There has been an influx of non-US residents visiting the United States and residents travelling domestically. This grows attendance at industry establishments since more tourism leads to higher revenue gains for historic sites, helping to offset some of the losses from stifled government funding.",

Revenue can be generated through admission fees, special tours or traveling exhibits, membership services, food and beverage options, merchandise and government funding or donations from customers.",

However, they tend to have higher-than-average educational backgrounds and tend to have higher income levels, with the majority of the industry's customers having an annual household income of more than $60,000.",

Most industry operators are small and receive relatively few visitors annually. The significance of small sites keeps market share concentration from growing too high, while the established prominence of larger players keeps it from falling to a low level.",
        "Operators in the Historic Sites industry operate with high fixed costs and fewer variable purchasing costs. Most operators are nonprofit entities and do not report traditional profit.
