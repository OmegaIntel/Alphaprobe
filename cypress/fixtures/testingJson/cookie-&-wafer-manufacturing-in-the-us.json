Although revenue drastically declined initially, signs of recovery emerged post-pandemic, and losses slowed but persisted. Sales continue to struggle as health-conscious consumers avoid high-sugar snacks like cookies, and a substantial and expanding portion of domestic demand is satisfied by imports. Revenue has been sinking at a CAGR of 2.0% over the past five years and is expected to slip 0.6% in 2024, reaching $6.1 billion.",

However, in recent years, disposable income has expanded and consumer spending is climbing. Despite spending more, consumers are making different decisions on where to spend their money. Many contend with climbing necessary grocery costs, deterring cookie and wafer purchases when making household grocery trips."

Attempting to cut costs, producers have minimized their workforces, reducing the average number of employees per facility. Many opted to retain and hire less skilled or knowledgeable workers. Regardless, wage costs climbed, as sales continued to shrink. The average cookie and wafer producer started the period with historically low profit, and rising production and wage costs have inhibited profit growth, keeping it extraordinarily slim and deterring new entrants."

In the coming years, consumers will become increasingly health conscious.

The development could provide a key opportunity for producers, as imports have ballooned to capture more than one-third of domestic demand. With a price-based competitive edge, domestic consumers can appeal to at-home markets and regain some of the lost domestic sales they once had. However, brand loyalty is often strong with imported foods, especially snack foods, since the difference in price can be negligible, so weakening imports hold on domestic demand will likely be minimal."

Meanwhile, artificial intelligence (AI) will be used to conduct better quality control with greater regularity, improving the manufacturing process. Many companies will invest substantially in research and development in an effort to cater to shifting consumer demands. Healthier ingredients will be a large source of investigation, but also ways to reduce reliance on traditional suppliers to improve operational costs."

Many consumers may increasingly opt for imported products as opposed to domestically produced cookies and wafers. Imports are expected to account for 33.3% of domestic demand in 2023."
        },
        {
            "question": "Does your company specialize in a range of products or brands?",
            "answer": "The industry's leading companies are large consumer packaged goods conglomerates. These companies are able to limit risk from changing consumer preferences. Many brands are still fairly specialized, offering an array of cookies and wafers."
        },
        {
            "question": "Has your company been exposed to volatile input prices in recent years? How do you contend with fluctuations in key input prices?",

        {
            "question": "What do you do to safeguard your company's proprietary information?",
            "answer": "To adapt to changing consumer preferences, companies have increasingly invested in research and development to continue to hold market share by developing new products and improving existing ones. Some companies may patent recipes to protect information."
        },
        {
            "question": "Does your company automate any production processes?",
            "answer": "Manufacturers rely on equipment for mixing dough and baking cookies and wafers. Although some companies still rely on manual labor for other processes in the cookie production process, others have begun to automate the production line, reducing wage costs."
        },
        {
            "question": "Has your company contended with any increasing regulatory expenses recently? How did COVID-19 and related safety measures affect profit?",
            "answer": "Manufacturers have contended with little changes in regulatory expenses in recent years. Many have had to increase costs and safety measures during the pandemic. Some companies reduced their workforce in facilities at any given time, while others took on additional measures to promote social distancing and mask mandates."

            "question": "How has volatility in commodity prices and key inputs affected your company's profitability?",
            "answer": "The industry relies on wheat, sugar and other ingredients to make wafers and cookies, so volatility in these key inputs can directly affect profitability, particularly for companies without favorable contracts with suppliers to mitigate fluctuations. Growth in wheat prices have put downward pressure on profit."
        },
        {
            "question": "How does your company's profit compare to your leading competitors?",

        },
        {
            "question": "Have you been able to pass on price increases to consumers? How do you fare with volatile input costs?",
            "answer": "Sugar and wheat are the two key ingredients in cookies and wafers. As purchase costs are the largest cost for manufacturers, some companies may be inclined to pass along these price increases to boost profit while others may be reluctant to maintain competitive pricing. Companies with solid brand loyalty may pass along price increases with more ease."
        },
        {
            "question": "How do you adapt to changing consumer preferences? Have you launched any new products in recent years?",
            "answer": "As consumers have increasingly adopted grain- and gluten-free diets, companies have needed to continue to expand their product portfolio to cater to niche markets."

        {
            "question": "How do you limit impacts of volatile input costs? Do you have secure contracts with suppliers?",
            "answer": "Companies must ensure adequate contracts with suppliers to maintain the high quality of ingredients and reduce volatility. Purchasing ingredients at fixed prices can minimize input costs and assist with production planning."

            "question": "How has fluctuating wheat flour consumption affected your company's financial performance? Have you pursued grain- or gluten-free product lines?",
            "answer": "As one of the main ingredients in most cookies and wafers is wheat or other starch, revenue can fluctuate with consumer preferences. Consumers have increasingly adopted gluten- or grain-free diets, reducing demand for cookies and wafers."
        },
        {
            "question": "How did your company fare during COVID-19? How have you performed with overall growth in disposable income?",
            "answer": "Per capita disposable income soared during the pandemic because the government gave out lots of aid. When disposable income levels are low, consumers tend to cut back on discretionary foods, such as desserts, or opt for less expensive and private-label brands."
        },
        {
            "question": "How do you deal with consumers' increasing demand for healthy food? How have you adjusted operations to changing dietary trends?",
