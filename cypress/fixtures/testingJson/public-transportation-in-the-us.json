    "executive_summary": "Figures have been adjusted for inflation and are presented in 2024 currency.\n\nOver the past five years, public transportation services have faced significant fluctuations. The COVID-19 pandemic brought unprecedented challenges, severely reducing ridership as lockdowns and business closures curtailed daily commuting. Government intervention played a critical role in maintaining and revitalizing public transit. The Biden administration's Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, signed in 2021, earmarked $1.0 trillion for infrastructure and transportation initiatives over the next decade. Increased federal funding in 2023 helped offset previous declines in economic performance, which cut state budgets and pressured public transport. As the economy recovered, higher disposable income led some commuters to choose premium transport options like Uber and Lyft, particularly in cities with ride-sharing restrictions. Revenue has been declining by a CAGR of 2.5% over the past five years, and is expected to decrease by 2.0%, reaching $83.3 billion in 2024.",

        {
            "question": "How has discretionary spending affected your major consumers?",
            "answer": "Increasing discretionary spending is generally harmful to the industry. When people have more money to spend, private transportation modes, including personal vehicles and taxi ridership, increase. This decreases demand for industry services."

        {
            "question": "Is your operation located in an area with a high number of potential customers?",
            "answer": "Cities with large populations are generally the largest operators of industry organizations. For example, New York City is the largest city in the country and operates the largest transportation organization."

            "answer": "Autonomous technology is not used on a wide scale in the United States, though select systems do use this technology. For example, the Newark International Airport monorail operates without a human at the controls."
        },
        {
            "question": "How is your company leveraging new technology, such as 3D printing, Internet of Things (IoT) and autonomous vehicle usage in its operations?",
            "answer": "Operators are leveraging new technology to create better, safer rides. For example, rail-signal technology is being used to improve safety, while traffic-signal technology implemented to increase bus speeds."
        },

            "question": "Do you work with trade associations or other interest groups to advance your company's interests?",
            "answer": "Trade organizations are not extremely important in this industry, given the relationship between operators and the government. For example, in New York City's MTA, state and local governments play a role in who works on the agency's board."

        {
            "question": "How does your company stay ahead of regulations such as energy-efficiency standards?",

            "question": "How does your company's profit compare with your main competitors?",
            "answer": "Profit margins are generally low or negative. The nation's largest system, New York's Metropolitan Transportation Authority, routinely operates at a loss."
        },
        {
            "question": "How loyal is your customer base? How do you ensure repeat customers? What percentage of revenue is devoted to retaining customers?",
            "answer": "The customer base is very loyal when it comes to public transportation as it is cheaper compared to owning a car and using a cab every day. To ensure repeat customers, weekly, monthly and sometimes yearly passes are sold, which are cheaper compared to single rides."
        },
        {
            "question": "Do you monitor changes in government regulations? Have you had any issues with government regulations in the past?",
            "answer": "Public transit authorities must comply with federal, state and local licensing, safety, financing and regulatory requirements. Regulations in this industry are mainly related to safety, so there have been very few incidents in which issues have been raised with government agencies."

            "question": "Do you monitor unemployment rates to plan your business accordingly? How has low unemployment benefited your business in the past?",
            "answer": "The total US workforce is an important indicator of industry demand, as the majority of public transit systems are used primarily by commuters. A low unemployment rate leads to more people using public transportation to reach their workplaces."
        },
        {
            "question": "How much do you rely on federal funding? How do you plan to mitigate this threat?",
            "answer": "Federal, state and local governments are important sources of public transit funding because the majority of operations are largely subsidized by taxes and grants. By increasing revenue generated through single-trip riders, the threat from federal funding can be reduced."
        },
        {
            "question": "Do you keep track of urban population growth? How are you attracting more of this increased population to your services?",
            "answer": "Urban population growth drives demand for urban transit systems, as most individuals in densely populated cities rely on public transportation. Developing new stations near urban populated areas, people can be attracted to use public transportation."
