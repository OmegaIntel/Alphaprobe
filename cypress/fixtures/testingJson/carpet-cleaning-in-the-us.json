Revenue for the industry is expected to increase at a CAGR of 3.9% to $6.6 billion going into 2023, including a rise of 0.8% in 2023 alone. Demand for carpet cleaning services has improved over this period as growth in household formation rates has expanded the available client base for industry operators and rising per capita disposable income has enabled consumers to purchase cleaning services. Additionally, from 2017 to 2020, declining office vacancy rates, increasing nonresidential construction activity and growth in the number of businesses have broadened operators' potential client base in the business sector, as more office and retail space naturally increased demand for commercial carpet cleaning services.",

By 2023, these forces will have grown as more consumers will have more disposable income due to higher employment and income levels. Households have chosen professional carpet cleaning services over less expensive, do-it-yourself options because they have more money to spend. The expansion of businesses has also contributed to an increase in market income for commercial carpet cleaning."

Although the main draw of hardwood flooring is its looks, buyers are also drawn to it because of its extended lifespan. Laminate flooring, which includes luxury vinyl tile and vinyl sheets, is another alternative to carpeting that has grown in popularity over the past several years. Although laminate flooring products usually cost half as much as traditional hardwood flooring, they are just as durable and have a wood appearance."

Most carpet cleaning businesses have just one location and one to two staff members. Most carpet cleaning businesses are situated in locations with more than 100,000 households near and conduct their business locally. As of 2023, small and large carpet cleaners have changed prices. Despite a little rise in sector employment over the last five years, carpet cleaning is still a labor-intensive job."

The fact that hardwood or laminate flooring can considerably increase a home's value is one reason why more homeowners have chosen to install it. Additionally, laminate is significantly less expensive than hardwood, which adds to its appeal to homeowners. Janitorial companies that bundle carpet cleaning into their service offers for customers are another fierce competitor in the market. This outside rivalry will probably temper the expansion of industrial establishment during that time."
