    "executive_summary": "The lamp and lighting stores industry specializes in selling lighting equipment and fixtures. Most sales are driven by homeowners seeking to furnish or remodel their homes, causing sales to move with consumer spending on home improvements. However, the COVID-19 pandemic negatively impacted sales as many stores had to pause or slow operations due to social distancing requirements. Declining residential construction value and rising inflation further harmed lighting fixture sales as they are considered luxury products. These trends caused industry revenue to drop at an estimated CAGR of 7.5% to $3.2 billion over the past five years, including a 4.6% decline in 2023 alone.",

COVID-19 resulted in weakening consumer confidence, forcing buyers to postpone unnecessary purchases like lamps. Rising inflation has caused the cost of living to rise, harming disposable income and lowering sales. However, rising electricity costs have supported demand for more energy-efficient lighting."

Following the pandemic, housing starts soared as disposable income expanded, resulting in a revenue jump in 2021. However, the weakening value of residential construction has discouraged home improvement projects, harming lamp sales."

This trend became more prominent during the pandemic when consumers avoided public spaces."
