    "executive_summary": "Figures have been adjusted for inflation and are presented in 2024 currency.\n\nHardware manufacturers produce a variety of metal hardware, including hinges, handles, keys, and locks, as well as coin-operated and time locks. The industry primarily serves the automobile manufacturing and construction markets, closely tying revenue to the economy's overall health. The COVID-19 pandemic hindered downstream industries' ability to function, decimating demand for hardware. Overall, revenue is expected to fall at a CAGR of 2.0% through the end of 2024 to reach $9.9 billion, including an anticipated gain of 0.7% in 2024 alone. Profit is expected to fall to 4.2% of revenue in 2024, down from 6.1% in 2019.\n\nManufacturers recovered somewhat in 2021 in line with the broader economy as social distancing requirements eased and government stimulus depressed operating woes. A hike in demand from residential construction in 2021 fueled industry growth. However, this gain was short-lived, as downstream demand from the automotive and residential construction industries fell. Rising interest rates caused demand for construction to tank. Meanwhile, rising oil prices constricted demand for automobiles. Also, volatility in the price of steel has made it difficult for manufacturers to pass purchase costs down to downstream markets, further weakening revenue.\n\nInterest rates are expected to ease in the coming years, mitigating the stress on the construction industry. Input prices, notably the price of steel, are expected to stabilize, easing cost pressures for manufacturers. Also, an expected devaluation of the US dollar will impede import penetration and expand demand from export markets, boosting revenue streams from overseas. Overall, the industry is expected to hike at a CAGR of 2.1% through the end of 2029 to reach $11.0 billion.",

            "current_performance_point_description": "Manufacturers were forced to halt operations during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic. Social distancing measures restricted the need from downstream construction and manufacturing markets, causing revenue to dip. The industry rebounded in 2021 in line with the broader US economy. Manufacturers enjoyed abundant downstream demand as restrictions eased. Also, government stimulus created an abundance of per-capita disposable income, much of which was diverted into housing starts and home improvement. This success was short lived, however, as rising interest rates restricted housing starts and spending on residential construction. Compounding this, extreme volatility in the price of steel, the industry's main input, made it difficult for manufacturers to pass expenses down to consumers."

Volatile steel and aluminum prices have made it difficult for hardware manufacturers to pass costs down to consumers, forcing less established manufacturers out of the industry.

Overall, input prices are expected to level in the coming years, allowing manufacturers to more reliably pass costs to downstream markets. The ongoing trade war with China is expected to limit import penetration. This will make it easier for manufacturers to retain control of domestic demand gained over the pandemic.
