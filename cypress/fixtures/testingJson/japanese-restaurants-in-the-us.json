            "cost_factor_description": "Profit for Japanese restaurants is expected to account for 4.4% of revenue in 2024, representing a contraction from 5.3% in 2019. Profitability is highly dependent on an operator's ability to manage wage and purchase costs, which are the two largest industry expense categories. Though wages in proportion to average revenue have fallen, purchase costs have risen, putting downward pressure on profit margins."

Similar to other food service industries, Japanese restaurants require highly trained staff, especially for those specializing in food items, like sushi. These restaurants often hire highly skilled chefs who have gone through years of training, along with ample support staff such as waiters, server's assistants and general managers. Wages have fallen over the last few years, undoubtedly thanks to the significant decline in the number of people working in food service since the pandemic."

Purchase costs have experienced slight change over the past five years, as the industry was affected by global supply chain disruptions and the price of seafood has risen significantly."

            "answer": "Fluctuations in availability of essential ingredients like seafood, rice and Japanese condiments impacted menu offerings and pricing. Sudden interruptions or delays in sourcing these items due to global events or logistical issues led to inconsistent quality or scarcity, affecting costs and customer satisfaction. Lockdowns, closures and reduced workforce in transportation caused logistical hurdles, delaying goods transportation from suppliers to restaurants and leading to inconsistent inventory levels."
