The battered economy benefited from strong government support via federal stimulus funding, including the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security (CARES) Act of 2020 and the American Recovery Act 2021, which also included additional funding measures for insurance subsides and private insurance coverage."

Currently, all children covered under Medicaid receive comprehensive dental benefits. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA) extended federal funding for Medicaid expansion in 2014, although 10 states have not adopted the expansion as of 2024, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation. The federal government is expected to push for Medicaid expansion, with government funding anticipated to grow as a share of industry revenue as a result."

As pediatric dentists turn to the DPMC model to contain operational expenses, they will be able to provide more specialized care, thus keeping patient referrals within the network."
