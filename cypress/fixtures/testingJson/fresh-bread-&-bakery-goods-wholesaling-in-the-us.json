Wholesalers shifted towards retail markets as restaurant demand dropped during the pandemic, which contributed to an overall revenue decline for the industry over the past five years. In particular, fresh bread and bakery goods wholesaler revenue is anticipated to edge downward at a CAGR of 0.5% through the end of 2024 to reach $70.1 billion despite expanding an estimated 0.3% in 2024 alone.",
