    "executive_summary": "The Franchise Resale Brokers and Consultants industry has grown over the five years to 2021 largely due to favorable credit markets and steady economic growth. Over the past five years, growth in the number of US businesses and greater private investment in the economy have helped increase both the availability of and demand for franchises. However, the industry also encountered a significant slowdown in business during the COVID-19 (coronavirus) pandemic as more prospective franchise owners put off investing in a new franchise until after the macroeconomy demonstrates signs of recovery. As a result, industry revenue is only expected to increase at an annualized rate of 0.2% to $93.5 million over the five years to 2021. IBISWorld estimates revenue to grow 5.4% in 2021 alone as low interest rates and a recovering macroeconomic environment spurs franchise-buying activity.",

Industry profit, measured as earnings before interest and taxes, is projected to account for 9.9% of revenue in 2021, down from 11.1% in 2016. This level remains in the range of the industry's historical rates of profitability, which exhibits minor fluctuations in line with revenue. The primary driver of the industry's shrinking profitability is due to recent increases in operating costs and lower demand for industry services which have materialized during the global health crisis."

Over the five years to 2021, the industry has experienced moderate growth.

Growth in the number of businesses is a vital determinant of industry revenue because an increase in the number of businesses leads to greater franchise opportunities, increasing demand for franchise brokers to sell new franchises."

The expansion of franchises has been further enabled by an increase in consumer spending that has supported many consumer-facing franchisors, increasing an annualized 2.4% over the five years to 2021. Many consumer-facing retail establishments thrive within the franchise business model. Hence, increased consumer spending supports franchise revenue growth, increasing profitability and incentivizing franchise expansion."

A strong domestic economy, characterized by consumer spending increasing an annualized 2.5% over the five years to 2026 and aggregate private investment increasing an annualized 3.0% during the same period, is expected to fuel industry demand. Furthermore, as corporate profit improves, more businesses are anticipated to seek franchising opportunities to further expand operations.
