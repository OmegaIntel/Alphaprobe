    "FAQs": [
        {
            "question": "How will your company be affected by rising imports?",
            "answer": "Imports represent a substantial threat to domestic hot tub manufacturers, as many foreign brands offer similar products for lower prices. Certain international regions can produce hot tubs at much lower prices than domestic manufacturers, so competing based on price is often futile; producers can invest in quality materials and highly skilled engineers to manufacture superior products and stand out from the pack."
        },
        {
            "question": "Does your company specialize in a niche or do you produce a diversified range of products?",
            "answer": "Larger operators manufacture a wide range of products, including outdoor hot tubs and whirlpool baths. Small operators tend to focus on a specific type of product, catering to a specific niche. The more diversification there is, the larger the potential consumer base, which bodes well for operators looking to expand their quantity of consumers."
        },
        {
            "question": "Is your company investing heavily in research and development to meet changing consumer preferences?",
            "answer": "Companies compete significantly based on the design, style and color options they offer. Companies also compete based on technology, based on things such as the quality and power of water jets. By investing in research & development, a company could simultaneously drive growth in emerging products while also keeping tabs on shifting consumer preferences as it relates to current products in the market."
        },
        {
            "question": "Has your company explored acquisition opportunities?",
            "answer": "Market share concentration has increased due to significant acquisition activity among larger operators and dozens of smaller manufacturers being forced out of the market."

        {
            "question": "What steps do you take to safeguard your company's proprietary information?",
            "answer": "Competition is often based on the technical properties and perceived quality of the product. US manufacturers' brand names and reputation for providing quality hot tubs offer them a competitive advantage in the domestic market that foreign manufacturers typically lack."

            "question": "How does your company compensate for the seasonality of cash flow?",
            "answer": "Sales of hot tubs, specifically outdoor products, can vary based on the season. In ground hot tubs cannot be installed properly if the ground is too wet, such as when it may be covered in snow in the winter. Seasonal sales and holidays are another opportunity for a company to produce extra cash flow, since consumers will be more inclined to spend money during holiday sales or warmer weather."

            "question": "Has your company been able to integrate technology into your business to lower labor costs? Ability to reduce labor costs",
            "answer": "Companies that can successfully integrate technology to lower labor costs have a competitive advantage.

        {
            "question": "What downstream ownership links does your company currently have? Is your company pursuing any other ownership links?",
            "answer": "Downstream hot tub distributors and retailers charge considerable mark-ups for hot tubs. Manufacturers that control their own distribution network can experience higher profit by removing the retailer's cut from the final price of hot tubs. By controlling distribution networks, a company can lower its marginal costs during the production process and avoid processing issues within the broader supply chain."
        },
        {
            "question": "How do changes in plastic prices affect your margins? Are you able to pass on cost increases to your buyers?",
            "answer": "When the price of plastic increases, hot tub manufacturers experience higher material costs, which cuts into profit. By passing those excess costs onto consumers, a company could increase its profit margin and withstand price volatility of raw goods such as plastic materials."
        },
        {
            "question": "How quickly do your sales change based on trends in disposable income? Do you market your products differently when the economy is strong?",
            "answer": "When household disposable income is high, consumers are more willing to splurge on hot tubs and spas for their homes. If a company can maximize marketing efficiency during economic downturns, it can raise its profit margins while also bolstering revenue by focusing on key consumer demographics, such as households with incomes over $100,000."
        },
        {
            "question": "How many of your customers are homeowners? Do you plan on increasing marketing to better appeal to homeowners?",
            "answer": "Hot tubs are relatively long-term purchases for consumers, and as private spending on home improvements increases, it is more likely that this kind of spending will include individuals purchasing new hot tubs. If private spending on home improvements stagnates, it might not make sense for a company to market its goods towards homeowners, with potentially better alternatives available in the commercial sector instead."
