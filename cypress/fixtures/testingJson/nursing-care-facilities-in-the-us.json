The growth of telehealth and technology like smart beds and wearables has improved efficiency, allowing facilities to meet demand and raise the quality of care. But Government funding and reimbursement rates significantly impact revenues, with state discretion over reimbursements impacting overall revenue volatility during the period. Despite the pandemic's significant impact, industry revenue grew at a CAGR of 0.9% through 2023, projected to reach $155.4 billion in 2024 with a 0.6% revenue increase, hindered by lower Medicare and Medicaid funding.",

Many nurses experience burnout while working in these facilities, which is the mental, physical, and emotional exhaustion caused by a stressful job. This has contributed to the high turnover rate of employees. Hospitals and other healthcare settings can often offer better pay and benefits, making it harder for nursing care facilities to attract and retain skilled nurses, raising wage costs and impinging on profit."

The need for diverse care models will grow, especially as the need for specialized care for dementia or other health conditions rises along with this aging demographic. Medicare and Medicaid programs will instead cover most of these services as most individuals in need of this care don't have reliable private insurance. Federal funding is set to rise overall, but state regulations can impact revenue locally."
