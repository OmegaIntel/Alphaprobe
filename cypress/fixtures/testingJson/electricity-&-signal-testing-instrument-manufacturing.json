These products include a multitude of instruments used in electrical integration and testing equipment for electrical, radio, communication circuits, motors, and other niche devices. The industry benefits from a range of customers in varying industries, including defense and aerospace, automotive, and scientific research. The differentiation in downstream markets the industry serves has helped to shield the market from the extreme volatility that was experienced in 2020. Overall, industry revenue is expected to increase at an annualized rate of 0.7% to $12.6 billion over the five years to 2022, including an increase of 3.1% in 2022 alone.",

Increased federal funding for defense and research and development has propped up demand for industry products, especially during the second half of the period. Despite strong downstream demand, an appreciating US dollar has limited revenue growth and has aided in supporting import penetration into the United States, making domestic products less attractive to US consumers."

In addition to declining downstream private sector markets, there would also be a drastic decline in international trade, further dampening industry revenue."
