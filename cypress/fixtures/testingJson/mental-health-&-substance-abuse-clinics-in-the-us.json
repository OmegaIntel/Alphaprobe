The COVID-19 pandemic accelerated the extent of the mental health crisis in the US, straining an already overburdened industry. Federal funding helped clinics survive the pandemic, but inflation, workforce shortages and an evolving regulatory environment are challenging outpatient providers even as the need for outpatient treatment climbs to an all-time high.

Kickbacks promote overutilization of healthcare costs and corrupt decision-making by steering patients away from valid services. Physical self-referral law prohibits physicians from referring patients to a healthcare service if they or a family member have a financial relationship with that entity."
