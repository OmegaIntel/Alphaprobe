    "executive_summary": "Figures have been adjusted for inflation and are presented in 2022 currency. The Chlorine Manufacturing industry is composed of companies primarily engaged in the manufacturing of chlorine. The industry is commonly discussed as a part of the larger chloralkali industry, named after the industrial process for the electrolysis of sodium chloride solutions, which produces both chlorine and alkalis. This process is the dominant manufacturing technique for producing chlorine, sodium hydroxide (otherwise known as lye and caustic soda) and hydrogen gas as co-products. As a result, operators in this industry typically also sell these other two chemicals. Accordingly, industry operators are dependent on demand from downstream industries that use chlorine as a raw material input. Because many downstream customer industries, particularly chemical manufacturers, are cyclical in nature, revenue for the Chlorine Manufacturing industry is highly affected by changes in customer demand.",

Over the five years to 2022, the industrial production index, which measures the output of manufacturing, mining, electric and gas industries, grew for much of the period except for a sharp decline in 2020 due to the economic shutdown as a result of the COVID-19 (coronavirus) pandemic. Consequently, revenue is estimated to increase at an annualized rate of 4.0% to $1.9 billion over the five years to 2022, including a projected increase of 3.6% in 2022."

Electricity used directly in the manufacturing process is considered a raw material, not a utility, because industry products are generated using electricity. As a result, purchases represent the largest industry expense, expected to account for 32.5% of total revenue in 2022. Profit is forecasted to decline despite increasing revenue due to increases in the price of electric power and wage growth outpacing revenue growth."

Despite consolidation trends, new smaller companies have been entering the industry over the period. As a result, the number of industry operators grew an annualized 8.4% to 24. Similarly, industry employment grew at an annualized rate of 5.9% to 2,347 employees."
