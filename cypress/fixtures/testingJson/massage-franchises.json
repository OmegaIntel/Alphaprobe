    "executive_summary": "The Massage Franchises industry includes franchised outlets that provide therapeutic and recreational massage services. The popularity of massage services has surged over the five years to 2021 as consumers increasingly spend on luxury goods. Furthermore, new research touts the health benefits of massages, benefiting the industry. The improving economic environment and increasing visibility of massage franchises are expected to encourage strong growth in the Massage Franchises industry during the period. While the majority of massage therapists are sole proprietors, the popularity of massage franchises has grown over the past decade. Franchisees benefit from efficient operating and support systems, along with increased advertising and name recognition. Therefore, during the current period, revenue is expected to rise an annualized 15.4% to $2.5 billion. Although the industry's growth was disrupted in 2020 as a result of the COVID-19 (coronavirus) pandemic, revenue is expected to bounce back with growth of 15.1% in 2021.\n\nAs a relative luxury service, the industry's largest market is high-income consumers. During the current period, increasing per capita disposable income encouraged consumers to pursue discretionary services such as massages. Furthermore, preference shifts toward healthier lifestyles strongly benefited this industry. Consumers increasingly recognize the health benefits of massages; according to the American Massage Therapy Association, 50.0% of adults who receive massages do so for health, medical or overall wellness reasons. Moreover, franchises in the industry provide customers with easy access to massage services, and industry brands have been increasing their market penetration over the past five years.\n\nAs the industry is young, it is expected to continue growing over the five years to 2026. Increasing health expenditure and consumer spending will likely support the industry's growth. Over the next five years, massage services are expected to become more mainstream and available to a larger customer base. Therefore, IBISWorld projects industry revenue to increase at an annualized rate of 15.8% to $5.2 billion over the five years to 2026. Profit is likewise expected to rise during the period.",

During the five-year period, per capita disposable income increased at an annualized rate of 3.3%. Thus, consumers had more discretionary income to spend on luxury goods and services. Additionally, consumer spending increased at an annualized rate of 2.4% over the past five years, indicating a growth in the pool of potential clients."

Total wages are expected to grow on par with revenue over the five years to 2021, climbing at an annualized rate of 18.0% to reach $1.4 billion.
