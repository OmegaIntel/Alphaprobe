The industry includes insurance brokers representing the buyer instead of the insurance company and agencies representing various insurance companies during the purchasing process. The industry is vital to the larger insurance sector as operators act as intermediaries between insurance providers and downstream clients. Operators generate income via commissions earned on policies sold. As a result, industry revenue grows as policy prices and volumes increase.",

As brokers and agents become more proficient in understanding the nuance of several different lines of insurance, they are more likely to provide them to their clients. Additionally, product offerings can differ significantly due to the types of clients each broker or agent caters to."
        },
        {
            "question": "How do you emphasize the value of your company's services?",
            "answer": "Insurance companies demonstrate their value to their clients by developing a deeper understanding of their unique insurance needs and helping provide them with insurance products to fill those needs. A broker or agent can foster this understanding by being in geographic proximity to the client and seeing how their business operates frequently to finely tailor these risk solutions."
        },
        {
            "question": "Are your operations spread across the country or are your establishments more concentrated in a certain geographic location?",
            "answer": "Insurance brokers open locations across the country, in line with population and business density, to cater to the most extensive client base possible. However, most brokers only cater to a small geography and a handful of client types in that small geography, with a few businesses operating at scale nationally."

            "question": "To what extent are your processes automated and how do you plan on investing in automation over the coming years?",
            "answer": "While some administrative services have been automated in recent years, insurance brokerage at its core is centered around personal relationships. This is mainly a result of the inherent difficulty in modeling out the risks and needs of a client through an algorithm. One of the ways an industry firm could cut down on labor costs is to accelerate automation of various tasks and positions. By investing more in technology that allows consumers to conduct more of their business online, the industry could save in the long term and expand its profit margin while also having an opportunity to use that online space as a platform for accelerating marketing outreach toward new consumers."

        },
        {
            "question": "To what extent are you affected by hard and soft pricing cycles?",
            "answer": "As insurance providers rotate between price hardening and softening cycles, insurance brokers generate higher commissions on policies sold as premiums rise during hardening cycles and vice versa during softening."
        },
        {
            "question": "How hard is it to promote your company to suppliers? How can you improve your relationships with suppliers?",
            "answer": "Agencies and brokerages must establish relationships with underwriters to increase the risk products they can offer in retail and wholesale markets. Proving to underwriters a deep understanding and ability to tailor these products to a wide array of customers will help an agent or broker begin to gather the ability to provide multiple lines of insurance from one carrier. By strengthening its marketing capabilities, an industry firm can improve its ability to reach a broad audience with its products, which bodes well for its supplier relationship. For example, GEICO's famous advertisements that allude to saving 15% on insurance coverage in a short amount of time would be one way in which industry firms can capture the attention of a potential consumer. The more potential customers the firm targets, the better off their growth will be, and the more their image will improve."

            "question": "Where are your distribution centers located? What kind of transportation do you rely on to deliver your products?",

        },
        {
            "question": "Do you monitor changes in government regulations? Have you had any issues with government regulations in the past?",
            "answer": "Insurance agencies and brokerages must comply with state and federal legislation affecting the entire insurance sector."
        },
        {
            "question": "Do you track changes in the homeownership rate? How can you maintain demand when the homeownership rate decreases?",
            "answer": "An increase in the homeownership rate typically translates to higher demand for insurance and commissions. If the homeownership rate decreases, an industry firm could increase its digital advertising space with more investment in online advertisements."
        },
        {
            "question": "How will an increase in the number of people with private health insurance affect your revenue? How much of your revenue comes from health insurance?",

        },
        {
            "question": "How can you take advantage of an increase in motor vehicle registrations? How much of your revenue comes from automobile insurance?",
            "answer": "The number of cars registered influences industry demand for individual automotive insurance. While automotive sales have little effect on the number of vehicles on the road, they are an essential indicator of policy prices because newer cars are usually costlier to insure."
