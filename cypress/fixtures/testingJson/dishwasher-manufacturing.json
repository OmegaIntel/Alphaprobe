Demand has been underpinned by an increase in rising per capita disposable income during the period. Conversely, rising imports and falling exports have suppressed growth in industry revenue. As a result, domestic manufacturers have fulfilled a decreasing share of domestic demand for dishwashers. Over the five years to 2022, industry revenue is expected to increase at an annualized rate of 3.2% to $2.5 billion, including a 0.1% increase in 2022.",
