    "executive_summary": "Herbal tea producers have prospered over some of the five years to 2024 because of an expansion in health consciousness and tea consumption among consumers. Consistent demand from the aging population is attributable to intense marketing by herbal tea producers to boost awareness about the health benefits of herbal teas. Price-premium teas with organic blends have become popular amid expanded discretionary income levels. However, competition from low-cost imports has offset most domestic tea demand expansion amid the strengthening US dollar. IBISWorld estimates that herbal tea revenue will expand at a CAGR of an estimated 0.2% to $470.0 million through the end of 2024, including an estimated 0.6% increase in 2024 alone. COVID-19 has been a contributing factor to this low annualized growth in revenue across the industry. Meanwhile, profit will inch down to represent approximately 8.7% of revenue in 2024.",

This can harm domestic tea producers who lose the international market share, leading to potential job losses in the sector."
