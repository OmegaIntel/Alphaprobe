Qualified Improvement Property (QIP) tax write-offs enabled owners of nonresidential structures to deduct the costs of improving their structures on their taxes. These write-offs make HVAC installation less expensive, keeping demand for the industry's services artificially high amid economic turmoil."

This dynamic particularly drove growth in 2021. Beginning in 2022, in response to rising inflation, the Federal Reserve has either hiked or held interest rates steady, driving up mortgage rates and driving down residential construction activity.
