    "executive_summary": "The Prepared Frozen Fish Production industry processes fish and seafood into prepared frozen products (including whole dinners, fillets, surimi, soups and chowders). Over the five years to 2021, industry growth has been driven by improvements in the overall economy. In particular, rising disposable income has enabled consumers to purchase more seafood, giving way to rising per capita seafood consumption. However, the COVID-19 (coronavirus) pandemic led to stagnated seafood consumption as a surge in the unemployment rate pressured consumer spending, leading to households opting for less expensive options. Overall, industry revenue is expected to rise at an annualized rate of 2.6% to $9.5 billion over the five years to 2021, including a growth of 2.8% in 2021 alone as the economy recovers from the pandemic.",

Over the five years to 2021, per capita seafood consumption increased at an estimated annualized rate of 1.3%. As consumers become busier and have less time to spend on leisure activities, demand for convenient and time-saving products, such as frozen entrees and fish fillets, grows. Thus, frozen foods tend to benefit from busy schedules."

When the price of shellfish rises, the unit-cost price of goods increases, which operators are then able to pass on to consumers in the form of higher prices. Heightened price tags have, in turn, led to an increase in revenue for the average operator. Thus, the rising price of seafood has further boosted revenue growth."

The industry has struggled with maintaining a steady flow of fish and shellfish inputs over the past five years. However, long-term volatility in seafood prices has strained profit over the five years to 2021. Additionally, increased operating expenses and lower efficiency during the coronavirus pandemic placed further downward pressure on industry profitability. Nevertheless, the industry ultimately experienced profit expansion, driven by rising demand for seafood, boosting profit (measured as earnings before interest and taxes) from 2.7% of revenue in 2016 to 2.8% in 2021."

Seafood is typically more expensive than substitute proteins (e.g. red meat and poultry), so consumption of seafood is affected by price from the consumer standpoint. As the US economy strengthens, per capita disposable income is expected to increase, which can increase the appetite for seafood, measured in the amount of seafood consumed per capita."

Nevertheless, continued marketing expenses and other added costs to regain market share is expected to pressure profitability.

The lower labor costs in this industry's top trading partners, typically Asian countries, enables foreign operators to keep prices lower than domestic operators."

            "answer": "The price of fish and seafood is affected by global supply and demand trends. When the price of seafood rises, per-unit costs of finished goods also rises. Operators then pass these higher costs downstream to their customers in the form of higher prices, boosting revenue."
        },

            "question": "How does demand for your products correlate with per capita disposable income? How are your products priced?",
            "answer": "Per capita disposable income is a key determinant of consumer spending.
