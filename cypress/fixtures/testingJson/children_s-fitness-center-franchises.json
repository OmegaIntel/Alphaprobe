    "executive_summary": "The Children's Fitness Center Franchises industry has grown over the five years to 2022, driven by rising per capita disposable income and growing awareness of child obesity. To help mitigate child obesity, some children's fitness center franchises have offered balance, coordination and other forms of training. However, franchises have contended with rising external competition, notably from afterschool programs, child athletic programs and child daycare programs, thus limiting revenue growth opportunities. Further, the COVID-19 (coronavirus) outbreak weighed on industry demand in 2020. Nonetheless, demand is expected to pick up as the pandemic subsides and a large share of the population has been vaccinated. Over the five years to 2022, industry revenue is expected to rise at an annualized rate of 0.7% to $574.7 million, including a 0.3% decline in 2022 alone.",
