Versatility and simple cooking instructions keep demand for the industry relatively stable, despite changes in consumer diets and preferences. Even as gluten-free and grain-free diets have become more popular, the industry has maintained demand by offering alternative products. Instead, changes in prices have affected industry revenue over the five years to 2023. During the period, the world price of wheat has surged due to supply chain disruptions. Additionally, while imports have increased, domestic manufacturers have made efforts to increase exports.",

When lockdowns were lifted in 2021, demand from consumers fell, leading to revenue declines. However, as the economy returned to a normal state in 2022, revenue returned to growth.

Imports contribute a major part to the competition, with Italy alone accounting for more than half of the industry imports, whereas an increased production in low-wage countries like Mexico and China threatens the domestic industry further.
