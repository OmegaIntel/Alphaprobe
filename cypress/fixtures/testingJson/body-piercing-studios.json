Piercing and body modification has existed for thousands of years; however, in modern times, piercing has been a relatively stable fashion trend. While piercings, such as navel piercing and nipple piercing, move in and out of style, piercing in general has remained popular for the past several decades. Commonly accepted styles in particular, such as ear piercings, have had strong staying power, keeping the industry relevant throughout its history.",

Additionally, the average industry profit margin, measured as earnings before interest and taxes, has declined over the past five years, comprising an estimated 7.6% of revenue in 2021."
