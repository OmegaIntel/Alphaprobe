According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), 3.4 million people in the United States currently have a diagnosis of epilepsy. For individuals with epilepsy, adherence to medication is essential to prevent or minimize seizures and reduce their effect on everyday life. While epilepsy medication has been available commercially for more than a century, only in the past 25 years have significant strides been made in regard to improvements in its pharmacology and safety. Still, the development of new innovative epilepsy medications with greater efficacy is at the forefront of epilepsy treatment. As a result, industry growth is most reliant on patent expirations, approvals of new drug applications from the Federal Drug Administration and investment into research and development. In all, industry revenue is expected to rise an annualized 5.5% to $6.6 billion over the five years to 2022, including an increase of 1.9% in 2022 alone.",

Moreover, cost-control measures are expected to intensify to address the rapidly rising cost of some brand name medications. Most notably, the patent granting market exclusivity to UCB SA's (UCB) Vimpat expired in March 2022. Vimpat has had patent protection since 2008, and thus, no generic alternatives were available. Following the expiration of the patent, a generic substitute of Vimpat had been approved by the Food and Drug Administration and is now marketed by generic pharmaceutical manufacturers. While the sales of Vimpat are likely to fall off during the outlook period, brand-name epilepsy medications with strong reputations are likely to remain popular, especially among those that have already found success with a brand-name medication. Moreover, many epilepsy patients cite safety and quality concerns regarding the switch from brand name to generic."

This medication is the first of its kind, as it produced for a specific type of seizure.
