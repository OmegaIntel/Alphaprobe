    "executive_summary": "Fluid power equipment distributors have faced volatile conditions following swings in the economy stemming from the pandemic. Fluid power equipment has a variety of uses, allowing distributors to diversify their client base. This prevents major swings in revenue if a single downstream market is affected. The pandemic hindered the manufacturing and mining sector, generating the bulk of revenue as businesses were forced to operate at limited capacity or shut down temporarily. The residential construction market was a saving grace for distributors, preventing companies from exhibiting a major slump in revenue. As the economy recovered and businesses reopened, the need for equipment rebounded slightly. Overall, revenue is expected to decline at a CAGR of 1.2% over the five years to 2023.",

Even so, the pandemic caused most markets to slump, significantly hindering sales. Many mining and manufacturing industries closed temporarily or operated at a limited capacity. A lone bright spot was using fluid power equipment in residential construction as low-interest rates spurred homebuilders to take on new projects."

            "current_performance_point_description": "Following the pandemic, declining sectors recovered, bolstering the need for fluid power equipment. A massive uptick in oil prices expanded the market for equipment to help with drilling efforts. The pandemic accelerated e-commerce platforms because of stay-at-home orders, causing an increased reliance on the internet. This gave distributors an advantage against direct-to-manufacturer purchasing, as manufacturers have a limited online web presence."

Even so, larger and more prominent companies that secure exclusive contracts with upstream manufacturers may be able to procure the inventory at a lower cost, earning a higher markup when selling it. Distributors may secure such agreements in exchange for heavily marketing the manufacturer's product. While profit is low for the most part, large companies continue to engage in heavy acquisition activity to expand, as smaller companies are unable to keep up with challenging conditions and rising competition."

Rising corporate profit will allow markets to replace existing equipment with new ones or upgrade parts and accessories to keep systems running smoothly. As inflation gradually contracts, the Federal Reserve is expected to reduce interest rates, causing the cost of borrowing to fall. This will encourage markets to up their investment in equipment."

This will reduce significant spending from oil drilling companies as they cut costs following reduced revenue. Even so, fluid power equipment is essential for drilling and helps businesses easily operate heavy machinery. While revenue is set to dip in these markets, it will be minimal. As prices return to pre-pandemic levels, distributors will better understand the market and adjust their inventory accordingly to ensure they do not overstock on extra equipment."

Even so, direct manufacturer-to-consumer sales are set to rise as many markets seek ways to reduce costs and cut the middleman out entirely. Even so, reputable distributors will still thrive because of exceptional customer service and quick turnaround times. Competition will intensify with distributors servicing a saturated market. To be successful, distributors must differentiate themselves from competitors through value-added services (think broadening the range of fluid power equipment offered to serve as a one-stop shop for various downstream users and offering superior customer services). Smaller companies that do not have the capital resources to keep up in a saturated area may be forced to exit or be consolidated by a larger company."

        "Consolidation activity continues to make waves among distributors despite lower profitability. Larger companies are acquiring smaller companies to expand their domestic footprint and extend their product offerings to remain competitive.",
        "Licensing requirements vary based on the distributor's target market. Distributors selling exclusively to other businesses only need a wholesaler's license, whereas those engaged in both wholesale and retail sales require a retail tax license.",
        "Though wholesalers don't directly receive government assistance, they can access support through different trade associations. Associations like the National Fluid Power Association and Fluid Power Distributors Association play a direct role in assisting wholesalers by advocating for fluid power technology.",
        "Retail sales have been declining due to the nature of fluid power equipment. Clients generally opt for bulk purchases for cost efficiency instead of buying a few pieces from a retailer.",
        "The Southwestern region of the United States, specifically Texas serves as a significant energy hub. Fluid power equipment plays a crucial role in performing diverse tasks associated with oil drilling in this area.",
        "Automobile manufacturers use fluid power equipment to enhance brake systems. The Great Lakes are a pivotal hub for automobile manufacturing, granting distributors convenient access to a broad client base.",
        "Wholesalers face external competition from direct-to-manufacturer sales. Even so, wholesalers pride themselves on customer service and quick turnaround times to attract clients.",
        "No company holds a market share of more than 5.0%. Fluid power distribution is highly fragmented, with lower barriers of entry.",
        "Some larger companies partake in consolidation. Applied Industrial Technologies, the largest distributor, has made multiple acquisitions over the years.",
        "Purchase costs have remained relatively steady. While purchases can vary depending on downstream markets, equipment used for manufacturing, mining and extraction generates higher profit levels, reducing purchasing costs as a share of revenue."
