They also adapt to competition by introducing innovative products, reducing prices strategically and entering into strategic partnerships or mergers with international brands."
        },
        {
            "question": "Are your company's cigarette and tobacco sales significantly impacted by volatile economic conditions?",
            "answer": "While a healthy US economy benefits manufacturers, demand for their products can withstand periods of poor economic performance. This can even accelerate demand because of heightened stress."
        },
        {
            "question": "How do fluctuations in the price of tobacco and other key inputs impact your operations?",
            "answer": "The world price of tobacco (the industry's biggest input) has endured significant volatility. Regardless, tobacco consumers are typically unfazed by price changes, as solid brand loyalty and the addictive nature of tobacco products keep long-time smoker demand high."
        },
        {
            "question": "Does your company strategically establish operations close to upstream suppliers?",
            "answer": "The Southeast region is the most popular region for manufacturers because of the abundance of tobacco farms and the ease of obtaining inputs."
        },
        {
            "question": "How has your company adapted to new technologies producing increasingly popular substitute products like e-cigarettes?",
            "answer": "Most major cigarette and tobacco manufacturers have begun manufacturing or have acquired at least one brand of e-cigarettes, as health concerns drive many would-be smokers to take up e-cigarettes instead of traditional combustible cigarettes. While these developments have helped companies' overall performance, e-cigarettes are not industry-relevant. They have not assisted companies' industry-relevant performance."
        },
        {
            "question": "How have emerging technological innovations allowed your company to reduce reliance on a traditional workforce and reduce wage costs?",
            "answer": "Automation has been used heavily by cigarette and tobacco manufacturers for decades, keeping wage costs significantly lower than in many other manufacturing industries."
        },
        {
            "question": "Have regulatory changes impacted cigarette and tobacco manufacturers' profit?",
            "answer": "Regulatory changes like higher excise taxes, implemented in many countries, have reduced demand for tobacco products, thereby impacting cigarette and tobacco manufacturers' profit. Stringent marketing and advertising restrictions have limited manufacturers' ability to promote their products, potentially reducing sales and impacting profit."
        },
        {
            "question": "How does your company stay abreast of regulatory changes in an industry increasingly scrutinized by regulatory bodies?",

        },
        {
            "question": "How has your company's profit performance compared with the industry's largest manufacturers?",
            "answer": "The industry's most prominent companies regularly report double-digit profit with little deterring growth."
        },
        {
            "question": "Do fluctuations in input costs have a significant effect on your profit?",
            "answer": "Input prices do not strongly impact industry profit. Thus, while the world price of tobacco (the industry's key input) has fluctuated, companies have endured, as price hikes are not a significant deterrent for their customers."
        },
        {
            "question": "Are you able to leverage economies of scale? How do you compete with historically large companies that do successfully leverage economies of scale?",
            "answer": "A few large companies dominate the industry, benefiting from and leveraging economies of scale to maintain their hold on the industry. Due to the dropping demand for tobacco products and the strong market grasp by the industry's largest manufacturers, it's difficult for new companies to carve a path."
        },
        {
            "question": "What is your marketing strategy to attract customers to products that carry clear and significant consequences to users' health? Do you find new marketing avenues difficult since many have been closed off to tobacco producers?",
            "answer": "Many manufacturers have increasingly diversified their product portfolio to include more smokeless products, and the consequences of combustible cigarettes have deterred many new smokers. Still, many noncombustible substitute products, including increasingly popular e-cigarette products, are not industry-relevant."
        },
        {
            "question": "Have you been able to pass on cost hikes, mainly in the form of rising excise taxes, to your customers? How do you attempt to keep costs mitigated amid the dropping demand for cigarettes?",
            "answer": "Stemming from a boost in excise taxes and a drop in demand for tobacco products, the leading producers have pushed up their product prices to maintain earnings. While the swelling prices often deter new smokers, addicted, life-long smokers are willing to pay for the same product."
        },
        {
            "question": "As the percentage of smokers continues to drop, how has your company marketed its products in light of the growing stigma against tobacco? What alternative products do you offer?",
            "answer": "Operators investing in a diverse range of substitute products will be best equipped to adapt to an environment of fewer and fewer smokers."
        },
        {
            "question": "How have swelling excise taxes on tobacco products impacted your sales volumes? Can you generate sufficient revenue from selling lower volumes at higher prices?",
            "answer": "A boost in excise tax on tobacco products results in higher selling prices, deterring many casual or prospective smokers. Nicotine is highly addictive; long-time smokers are less deterred by high prices and will pay more for the same product."
        },
        {
            "question": "The price of industry goods has increased consistently for decades. How have rising selling prices affected demand for your company's goods? Does your product portfolio include a range of price points?",
            "answer": "Companies with a diverse product portfolio covering a range of price points are best equipped to handle shifting disposable income levels. A boost in disposable income typically results in higher sales of premium products and lower demand for bargain brands."
