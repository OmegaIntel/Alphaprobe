    "executive_summary": "Home furnishing stores sell various home furnishing products, including kitchenware, textiles, appliances, fixtures and decorative pieces. Industry revenue has been bolstered in recent years by a steady climb in both disposable income and housing starts. However, revenue growth has been constrained because of heightened competition and lockdowns restricting in-store shopping during the pandemic. Revenue is expected to climb at a CAGR of 1.7% to $69.5 billion through the end of 2024, including growth of 2.2% in 2024 alone. Meanwhile, profitability has diminished because of growing competition from online retailers and discount stores.",
