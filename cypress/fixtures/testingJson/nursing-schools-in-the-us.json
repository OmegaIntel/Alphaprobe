The aging of the baby boomer generation, as well as medical professionals' improved ability to treat ailments, have increased the number of patients in medical facilities. This, combined with the essential role of the healthcare sector amid the COVID-19 pandemic, has created a solid job market for those pursuing nursing careers. Despite growing demand, severe challenges to affordability in recent years have offset the early period's gains, and industry revenue has declined at a CAGR of 1.2% to an estimated $8.5 billion over the five years through 2024, when revenue is expected to climb 1.1%.",
