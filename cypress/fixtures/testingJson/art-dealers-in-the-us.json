            "question": "How does a rise in the Consumer Confidence Index benefit your company? How do you plan to mitigate the threat of a decrease in consumer confidence?",
            "answer": "Since art is a discretionary good, many consumers will only purchase it when they are confident in their current financial situation and believe the economy is performing well. This indicator tends to be more volatile in relation to disposable income. Therefore, if consumer confidence is high, people are more likely to buy art. If it is low, consumers will reduce their spending on art."
