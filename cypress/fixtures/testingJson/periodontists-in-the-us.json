    "executive_summary": "Figures have been adjusted for inflation and are presented in 2024 currency.\n\nThe economy's health significantly impacts periodontists' performance since out-of-pocket and private insurance are the primary sources of revenue and can be a source of volatility. But the root cause of volatility during the current period was the combination of COVID-19 and economic factors. The significant falloff in revenue in 2020 was mitigated by a quick recovery as per capita disposable income, healthcare expenditures and private insurance funded the pent-up demand. With technological innovations and improved access for an aging population propping up the recovery, industry-wide revenue is expected to rally at a CAGR of 1.2% to $15.3 billion through 2024, with a slight 0.6% bump in 2024.\n\nPeriodontists require additional education, specialized training and certification, and this tightens entry, limits substitution of other services and leads to higher fees. However, some practitioners join larger practices to stop ever-emerging products and technology with significant initial investments and repair and training costs from chewing up profit. These collaborative practice models offer periodontists the opportunity to share in economies of scale and a captive patient referral base.",
