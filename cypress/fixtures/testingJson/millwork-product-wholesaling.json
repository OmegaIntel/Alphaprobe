The industry is heavily dependent on domestic construction activity and generates the majority of revenue from residential construction in particular. Over the five years to 2021, the industry has benefited from strong growth in housing starts and private spending on home improvements. Even during the COVID-19 (coronavirus) pandemic, operators performed reasonably well, given the boost the crisis has had on housing markets.",

Although some operators in this industry also manufacture metal versions of industry products, the majority of industry revenue is generated by wood products. As a result, the price of sawmill lumber heavily influences this industry. As the price of sawmill lumber has increased during the current period, profit has contracted. In addition, the pandemic in 2020 and 2021 has caused some domestic supply chain disruptions, as many millwork manufacturers were forced to cease operations temporarily."
