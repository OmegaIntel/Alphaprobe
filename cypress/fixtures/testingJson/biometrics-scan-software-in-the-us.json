Businesses increased spending and allocated funding toward research and development of biometric scan software to increase security and accountability and reduce fraud. During the pandemic, investment levels declined as uncertainty grew and businesses were less willing to invest in biometric software. Consequently, industry revenue has been volatile but is projected to grow as cyber threats increase."

Biometric scan software is likely to grow extensively used across healthcare, construction, security and finance sectors at a higher rate than the consumer sector. Biometrics-based access control equipment and wiring will be installed in new office, commercial, and residential buildings by default. The banking industry will invest in user biometrics, particularly client scanning software, to secure payment transactions and limit the need for traditional passwords on their own."

Central and South America, in addition to the Asia-Pacific region, is expected to experience the highest growth in this sector. Development of security-based technologies will likely remain domestic due to the potential security risks of outsourcing. The growth potential of biometric scan software development is strong, but companies should also be aware of the increasing competition and potential risks of outsourcing."
