    "executive_summary": "Rising annual precipitation rates resulted in further grass growth, boosting lawn and outdoor equipment demand. Similarly, the industry supplies leaf and snow blowers primarily tailored for fall and winter; this has helped keep industry demand steady because of these yearly conditions. Downstream demand from the Landscaping Services industry (IBISWorld report 56173) also increased as the housing and construction markets expanded and homeowners and businesses took on lawn and garden repair and maintenance projects. So, industry-wide revenue has been increasing at a CAGR of 1.4% to an estimated $12.1 billion over the past five years, despite a projected 1.3% decrease in 2023, when profit is projected to drop to 2.0%.",

Lawn overgrowth tends to be a danger for consumers as taller grass becomes a more favorable environment for snakes and weeds, according to Simplify Gardening, encouraging demand for lawn and outdoor equipment. Weather patterns, like the fall season, boost industry demand by bringing more leaves to the ground, encouraging more investments in specific lawn and outdoor equipment like leaf blowers."
