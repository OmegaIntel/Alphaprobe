    "executive_summary": "Operators in the Cable Networks industry produce and acquire programs that it then supplies to third-party broadcasters for dissemination. The industry has responded to waning TV subscriptions by expanding its premium content offerings over the five years to 2021. In addition, the industry also derives a significant portion of its revenue from advertising fees. Therefore, industry revenue benefited as total advertising expenditure in the US rose to unprecedented levels. However, the rise in online streaming services and the recent spread of COVID-19 (coronavirus) deterred industry performance. Overall, IBISWorld projects industry revenue will stagnate at $94.0 billion over the five years to 2021 despite growing 1.1% in 2021 as the economic fallout of the coronavirus pandemic gives way to an economic recovery.",
