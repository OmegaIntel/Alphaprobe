    "executive_summary": "The Group Purchasing Organizations (GPOs) industry is composed of entities that leverage the purchasing power of groups of businesses to obtain collective discounts from vendors. GPOs earn most of their revenue by charging an administrative fee to vendors. For the past five years, demand for GPO services increased as the improving economy stimulated demand for various downstream industries, including the manufacturing and food service sectors. Meanwhile, rising access to health insurance drove demand from healthcare providers. The healthcare sector is by far the largest market for the industry, accounting for more than 60.0% of industry revenue. According to the Healthcare Supply Chain Association, a trade association representing the largest healthcare GPOs in the United States, more than 95.0% of all hospitals hold at least one GPO membership, and about 72.0% of all purchases that hospitals make are done using GPO contracts. Consequently, demand for medical services strongly affects demand for GPO services. As a result, over the past five years, industry revenue has been growing at an annualized 2.2%, and is expected to reach $6.3 billion in 2023. Despite this growth, profit has slightly declined because GPOs are limited in their ability to raise prices.",

COVID-19 also impacted demand for GPO services, with increased demand for personal protective equipment (PPE) and other medical supplies leading to higher purchasing volumes and tighter supply chains. At the same time, the pandemic also highlighted the importance of supply chain resilience and the need for GPOs to help their members navigate supply chain disruptions and shortages. According to the Healthcare Supply Chain Association, a trade association representing the largest GPOs in the United States, more than 95.0% of all hospitals held at least one GPO membership, and about 72.0% of all purchases that hospitals make are done using GPO contracts."

This has increased competition among GPOs for members and contracts. GPOs have expanded their services beyond traditional procurement to include other areas like data analytics, benchmarking, and consulting. This has enabled GPOs to differentiate themselves and offer more value to their members. One of the most significant examples of consolidation in the GPO industry was the merger of two of the largest healthcare GPOs, Vizient and MedAssets, in 2015. The merger created one of the largest GPOs in the healthcare industry, with a membership base of over 4,100 hospitals and $100.0 billion in purchasing volume."
