Baseball, football, soccer, hockey and basketball are all far more engaging sports for young athletes.

Some individuals find the etiquette, rules and dress codes off-putting, while others find that the game takes too long to play. But country club memberships are expected to rise over the coming years as high corporate profit and disposable income bolster demand from both businesses and individual consumers. Golf participation grows with increased leisure time, particularly among retired individuals who don't engage in more intense recreational activities. Consumer leisure time is expected to grow over the next five years, though at a restrained pace. This may generate more interest in the sport, especially as many customers of the industry are older and retired."

        },
        {
            "question": "Does seasonality affect sales for the products and services your company offers?",
            "answer": "Seasons have a strong effect on industry demand since most consumer demand for golf is in the warm summer months. Courses that are located in states with mild climates year-round, typically are able to operate throughout the year. Courses that are more affected by winter weather will likely limit operations during the off months."
        },
        {
            "question": "If your company benefits from population density, are you located in high traffic areas to increase your exposure?",
            "answer": "Industry operators must strike a balance when it comes to locations; operators benefit from locating near many downstream clients, though enterprises need access to enough affordable land to build a large course. Although population density is an important factor to attract customers, locating near affluent communities is also a key element for operators since high income earners are a large market segment."
        },
        {
            "question": "Are your products and services well-rounded to mitigate sudden changes in demand?",
            "answer": "Industry operators generally struggle during periods of weak economic demand, and changes in other demand drivers, since the industry's largest customer base is wealthy consumers."
        },
        {
            "question": "Has your company explored lowering wage costs through part-time labor and automation via point-of-sale systems?",
            "answer": "In recent years, average industry wages have increased. The industry is heavily reliant on customer service and physical labor. Therefore, to attract higher skilled employees, industry operators may have to increase wages."
        },
        {
            "question": "Have you established a strong internet presence through social media platforms to capture a larger audience?",
            "answer": "Many industry operators are working to grow their online and social media presence since younger generations are often swayed by online content and many players are looking to appeal to younger consumers. However, some clubs have built a reputation of being exclusive and therefore do not wish to have a strong online presence. These clubs depend on a loyal customer base."
        },
        {
            "question": "Are you up-to-date with legislative and regulatory changes that may allow your company to expand into new markets?",

            "question": "Is your company's profit margin in step with major competitors?",
            "answer": "The average industry profit margin is low and significantly brought down by public courses that operate as nonprofit entities. Profit is expected to have decreased over the past five years due to reduced demand. In 2023, the average industry profit margin is expected to account for 1.1% of industry revenue."

        {
            "question": "Do you develop off-season demand through alternative products and services to maintain steady cash flow during slower seasons?",
            "answer": "During the off-season, industry operators rely on demand for ancillary services, such as meals in the dining room and personal training sessions at the fitness center."

        {
            "question": "Have you been able to increase membership fees? How else have you mitigated cost increases?",

        },
        {
            "question": "How do you have a high turnover rate? Does your staff undergo constant training?",
            "answer": "Clubs in this industry need a highly competent workforce, including greenkeepers, restaurant staff and golf professionals and instructors. Having a skilled, professional staff is a key element in differentiating clubs from each other and providing value to consumers."

            "question": "Do you monitor household income in your area? Do you offer a variety of memberships?",
            "answer": "Consumers often decide on large expenses, such as country club or golf course memberships, based on changes in disposable incomes and their perceived ability to maintain current income levels in the future. In 2023, consumer confidence is expected to decrease."
        },
        {
            "question": "Do you expect major changes in demand due to rising per capita disposable income? How do you appeal to consumers with less disposable income?",
            "answer": "An increase in per capita disposable income generally translates to higher golf participation among casual golfers, raising revenue from green fees and benefiting the industry. Per capita disposable income is expected to increase in 2023."
        },
        {
            "question": "What percentage of your members earn more than $100,000 annually? How can you appeal to new clients in this demographic?",
            "answer": "Country club memberships are often very expensive; therefore, wealthier individuals are the most likely consumers to spend a significant amount of money annually on green fees and club memberships. In 2023, the number of households earning more than $100,000 is expected to increase."
