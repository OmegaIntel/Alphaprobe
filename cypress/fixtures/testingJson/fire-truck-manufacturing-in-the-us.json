Over the past five years, local and state government funding has decreased, reducing manufacturers' spending on new firefighting vehicles. However, federal funding for homeland security has grown, contributing to increased funding for the Assistance to Firefighters Grant (AFG) program. The AFG program assists fire departments in acquiring new vehicles and outfitting departments with safety equipment, which has grown to $370.0 million in 2023, up from $350.0 million in 2018. Over the five years to 2023, revenue has fallen at a CAGR of 6.0% to $2.2 billion, including an expected 2.1% increase in 2023. Profit is expected to account for 4.2% of revenue in 2023, remaining relatively unchanged from 2018.",
