    "executive_summary": "Leading up to 2024, the Contractors' Insurance industry has experienced a period of uneven performance, influenced by a combination of favorable and challenging factors. On the positive side, the industry benefited from the resiliency of the construction sector, underscored by 6.8% revenue growth in 2021. This growth resulted from a robust recovery in construction activity in 2021 after enduring lows during COVID-19 in 2020. However, the industry has also faced significant challenges, particularly recently. The rising cost of medical care and the aging construction workforce have contributed to upward pressure on workers' compensation insurance premiums. Furthermore, interest rate hikes have stunted construction activity, resulting in a decline in industry revenue in 2022 and 2023. Nonetheless, industry revenue has grown overall, rising at an annualized 0.6% over the past five.",

            "current_performance_point_description": "Before the onset of COVID-19, there was a trend of increasing construction activity in the US as more projects were undertaken, boosting demand for insurers. The pandemic disrupted supply chains, caused an economic downturn in 2020 and increased claims related to project delays and financial losses. Low interest rates, a backlog of delayed projects, government stimulus and a housing market boom in 2021 caused industry revenue to surge during the year, contributing to revenue growth overall since 2018. Construction activity has since cooled off, as rising interest rates have curtailed demand in the residential and commercial construction markets, causing revenue decline in recent years."

An aging construction workforce with the potential for musculoskeletal disorders (MSDs) contributes to higher workers' compensation claims. The rise in lawsuits against contractors, alleging negligence or project deficiencies, has driven concerns around claim costs and premium increases. These trends have contributed to tepid profit growth for insurers over the past five years."
