    "executive_summary": "The aging demographics of the United States have driven the growth of the Assisted Living Facilities industry. The number of adults aged 65 and older has been increasing consistently for the past two decades. Since the elderly are prone to injury and illness, many of them require assistance with their daily activities. The growing share of senior adults has propelled the need for services offered by assisted living facilities. As a result, the industry has struggled through the COVID-19 pandemic, but industry revenue has risen. Revenue is expected to grow at a CAGR of 2.7% to $45.5 billion over the five years to 2024, including growth of 2.9% during the current year. However, the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic created a severe disruption to the industry. The virus is especially dangerous to adults aged 65 and older, so assisted living facilities were particularly vulnerable to deadly outbreaks.",

This has especially been the case for assisted living facilities, which cater to seniors that are not yet in need of nursing care. The number of adults aged 65 and older has risen at a significantly faster rate than the overall population. Many needs of an aging population often can't be met at home, driving demand for assisted living facilities."

The virus is especially dangerous to adults aged 65 and older, so assisted living facilities were particularly vulnerable to deadly outbreaks at the height of the pandemic. With deaths occurring at significantly higher rates at facilities, many seniors opted to avoid to avoid assisted living facilities to reduce additional risk. The industry saw revenue contractions in 2020 and 2021 as a result, the first in more than a decade. Likewise, profit margins sank on account of reduced occupancy rates. With concerns about COVID-19 subsiding, the burgeoning elderly population will continue to propel the industry to growth."

Many adults over the age of 65 have been delaying retirement. People who have remained in the workforce until later in life have stronger savings accounts and pensions, better enabling them to afford the retirement lifestyle of their choosing. Assisted living facilities, which allow for more independent living lifestyles, are largely paid for by residents out-of-pocket."
