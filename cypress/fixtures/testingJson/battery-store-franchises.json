For most of the five years to 2021, industry operators benefited from broad economic improvements in the United States. Specifically, rising per capita disposable income has enabled consumers to spend more money on goods and services during the current five-year period, such as auto repair services. However, industry operators have experienced several challenges over the five years to 2021, including rising e-commerce and slowing overall brick-and-mortar retail demand as well as economic slowdowns caused by the COVID-19 (coronavirus) pandemic.",
