    "executive_summary": "Hog and pig farmers have been subject to intense volatility over the past several years as trade disputes and fluctuating commodity prices shook the industry. While the challenges of transporting live swine usually mean the industry has very little international trade, an outbreak of the serious African Swine Fever at the start of the period devastated nearly half of the Chinese hog population and forced them to raise imports. The trade war between the US and China caused the already low levels of US exports to China to drop to nearly zero in 2019, though, and the industry wasn't able to seize this monumental opportunity until it was too late. Still, exports to the country skyrocketed in 2020 and 2021 before dropping back down to pre-period levels, which combined with a post-pandemic spike in the price of red meat in domestic markets to boost revenue a staggering 39.9% in 2021 alone. In spite of this exceptional year, the intense volatility hog and pig farms have faced have tempered growth. Industry-wide revenue has been growing at a CAGR of 2.6% over the past five years and is expected to total $28.6 billion in 2023, when revenue will drop an estimated 6.6%.",

When the trade war was resolved, hog exports to China returned, skyrocketing nearly 6000.0% in 2020 and 167.8% in 2021. This unprecedented demand for both live swine and pork products from overseas drove revenue upwards at a year-over-year increase of 39.9% in 2021. However, it was too late for the industry to fully capitalize on the opportunity and exports to China plummeted 84.9% in 2022 as the nation rebuilt its swine herds and tensions lingered."

        {
            "question": "How do your operational strategies address biosecurity, and what impact does this have on overall productivity?",
            "answer": "Biosecurity is critical in the hog and pig farming industry because of the risk of disease outbreaks, which can significantly impact productivity."

        {
            "question": "Could you discuss any recent changes in your farming practices aimed at increasing operational efficiency?",
            "answer": "Operational efficiency plays a key role in competitiveness and profitability in the hog and pig farming industry, given its influence on cost-effectiveness and productivity. Automated feeders and high-yield diets are crucial to success."

        {
            "question": "How do you integrate advanced technologies in your farming operations to enhance productivity?",
            "answer": "Innovative technologies like automated feeders and cleaning systems can offer substantial enhancements in productivity, efficiency and sustainability in hog and pig farming."

        {
            "question": "What impact has digitalization had on your operations?",
            "answer": "The increasing adoption of digitalization in farming can help farmers monitor their herds' health. This improves animal welfare and leads to more informed decision-making."

        {
            "question": "How are you coping with compliance to shifting environmental regulations in hog and pig farming?",
            "answer": "Environmental regulations influence the resource management and waste disposal strategies of hog and pig farms. The USDA's oversight can significantly impact the industry's operations and, potentially, profitability."

        {
            "question": "Do you receive any federal subsidies? How much of your revenue do they comprise?",
            "answer": "Hog and pig farms receive little federal assistance. Upstream suppliers benefit from price floors and direct funding that buoys them against volatility."
        },
        {
            "question": "How do you manage fluctuations in feed prices?",
            "answer": "Heightened feed prices amid low crop yields dramatically boost the cost of farming hogs. Hog and pig farmers accordingly shift costs downstream through price hikes, but these increases can affect their attractiveness with consumers."
        },
        {
            "question": "How much of your production is under contract? What is your customer renewal rate?",
            "answer": "Many hog farms have contracts with pork production companies. This helps offset some volatility in demand and can make transportation costs more manageable."
        },
        {
            "question": "How much of your production is devoted to premium products? Do you spend on marketing to position your products as top-quality?",
            "answer": "Farmers that produce premium hogs (i.e. heavy weights) secure higher prices in livestock markets."

            "question": "Is your company dominant in any particular regional markets? Is there land available for potential expansions?",
            "answer": "Farms close to pork processors reduce transport costs and livestock transit time, reducing tissue damage and maintaining meat quality."

        {
            "question": "Do you have the ability to invest in new technologies like automatic feeders or climate control equipment?",
            "answer": "Successful farms have access to the most recent technology relating to breeding, feed mixes, climate control and health monitoring."

        {
            "question": "How has consumer demand for red meat changed in recent years? How do you compete with other meat and poultry producers?",
            "answer": "In the agricultural sector, higher prices for commodities, like red meat, boost farmers' revenue and returns because downstream buyers will generally pay the new price."
        },
        {
            "question": "Do your suppliers raise prices when feed costs increase?",
            "answer": "For pig and hog producers, a drop in the price of feed puts downward pressure on meat prices. This decreases returns and drags down revenue."
