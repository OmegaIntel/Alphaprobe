The steady growth in hospital demand and the crucial nature of medical treatments have provided some safeguards against economic downturns. In 2020, when faced with COVID-19 restrictions, industry revenue increased as most hospitalized patients needed IV products. But rising plastic materials and resin costs paired with a decline in overall health expenditure have curbed growth rates.",
