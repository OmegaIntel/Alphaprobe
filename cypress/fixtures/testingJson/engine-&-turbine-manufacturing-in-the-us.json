    "executive_summary": "Figures have been adjusted for inflation and are presented in 2024 currency. Engine and turbine manufacturers produce diesel truck engines, power transmission turbines and industrial transmissions. In addition to the production of engines and turbines, they also produce the parts and pieces required to fix and update existing products. Demand for these engines and turbines is reliant on a few different things. Exports and global trade conditions are the most important area since a lot of activity is generated through global trade. Through 2024 the industry faced significant problems stemming from global trade. This included an appreciating dollar, which made domestically produced goods less attractive to foreign buyers, as well as global supply chain disruptions, which would inevitably increase the cost of oil and steel.",
