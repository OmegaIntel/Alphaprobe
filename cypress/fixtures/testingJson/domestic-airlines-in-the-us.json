    "executive_summary": "In response to the stringent travel restrictions and lockdowns imposed by governments during the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic, the airline industry faced a severe decline in revenue, teetering on the edge of bankruptcy. The financial uncertainty was temporarily alleviated by a substantial stimulus package from the Department of Treasury, allowing airlines to survive until the restrictions eased. As pandemic conditions gradually improved, vaccination rates increased and travel regulations were lifted, there was a notable resurgence in domestic tourism and air travel. This pent-up demand led to a surge in airline revenues for two consecutive years post-reopening. However, this growth momentum was soon dampened by soaring inflation and elevated borrowing costs, which reduced consumer disposable income and shifted travel preferences toward more economical.",
