    "executive_summary": "Building Lighting Control System Manufacturers make components and develop software for building lighting control systems. Manufacturers derive their demand from a few different places. Downstream demand comes primarily from four markets, residential, commercial, industrial and institutional. Throughout the period, there has been a varying degree of demand from each market. During COVID-19, demand from all markets except residential clients was crushed. Following COVID-19, office buildings remained at a heightened vacancy rate as many companies continued remote work. On top of these harmful macroeconomic trends, import penetration remains the single largest threat to manufacturers during the period. The rapid appreciation of the US dollar has increased the presence of imports in the US economy, as US buyers purchase from foreign manufacturers since the US dollar is worth more in foreign economies. Due to numerous disruptions in downstream markets, industry-wide revenue has been falling at a CAGR of 4.2% to an expected $1.6 billion in 2023, when revenue is estimated to fall another 1.5%.",

As the dollar appreciated, exports came to a halt, dropping significantly in 2020 alone, rendering the industry's largest market effectively useless for the year. With mandates from the federal and state governments, any nonessential businesses had to cease production. Because of this, the industry lost demand from several crucial downstream markets. These include state and local institutions, colleges, commercial buildings and industrial clients."

Increasing interest rates have limited the expansion of industry operators as the cost of financing large projects becomes much more costly. This slowed down the rate at which companies needed new lighting systems. Increasing interest rates have affected downstream demand as exports, housing markets, and business activity are all sensitive to interest rate changes. The industry is set to experience falling demand across many downstream markets in 2023."
