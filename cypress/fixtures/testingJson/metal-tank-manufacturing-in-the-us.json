The industry returned to slight growth in 2021 and 2022, though this was short lived as revenue shrank again in 2023 as overall manufacturing activity slowed. Revenue is forecast to have dropped at a CAGR of 5.5% to $9.3 billion through the end of 2024, including an expected depression of 9.8% in 2024 alone.",
