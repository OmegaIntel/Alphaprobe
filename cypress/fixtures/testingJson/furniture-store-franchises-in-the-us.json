As a result of slowed growth over the past five years and a sharp decline amid the COVID-19 (coronavirus) pandemic, revenue for the Furniture Store Franchises industry is expected to decline at an annualized rate of 0.4% over the five years to 2020, reaching $2.4 billion.",

To combat this source of competition and to attract more customers, many industry operators have increased wage expenditure to attract more specialized employees that are able to help meet customers' needs, providing additional service. In addition, industry retailers have slashed prices to remain competitive with these other industries. As a result, profit, measured as earnings before interest and taxes, has declined over the past five years, reaching 3.0% of industry revenue in 2020."

However, benefiting the industry, in response to the coronavirus pandemic, many companies have shifted their employees to remote work, resulting in many individuals and household consumers increasing spending on home office furniture."

As establishments reopen and as home improvement expenditures resume, industry revenue is expected to increase at an annualized rate of 2.2% over the five years to 2025, reaching $2.7 billion.

Furthermore, industry operators are expected to increase wage expenditure to provide additional service to customers, a competitive advantage over online shopping and mass merchandisers that typically lack specialized customer service and interior design assistance for furniture shopping. As a result, industry profit, measured as earnings before interest and taxes, is expected to account for 3.8% of industry revenue in 2025, up from 3.0% in 2020."
