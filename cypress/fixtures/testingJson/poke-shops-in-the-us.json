    "executive_summary": "Figures have been adjusted for inflation and are presented in 2024 currency. Poke shops have successfully capitalized on the rising health consciousness of younger individuals. The minimal cooking associated with poke bowls is well-accepted by many wellness enthusiasts who try to avoid fats, oil and additives in daily meals. The high substitutability of ingredients in poke bowls also appeals to paleo and keto diet practitioners. In general, the Poke Shops industry revenue has expanded an annualized 4.9% to $2.0 billion over the five years to 2024. Poke shops have endured economic hardships in 2020 when COVID-19 hit. However, the affordability and convenience of poke bowls have somewhat mitigated revenue losses. After the pandemic subsides, demand has recovered as most of the population has returned to work. As favored by time-strapped working individuals, falling unemployment has boded well with industry growth. Nonetheless, rising inflation since 2022 has weighed on demand for poke as many individuals cut back on meals away from home. Simultaneously, rising food prices have pressured industry profit. Continued interest in healthy food will continue to support demand for poke shops. Younger individuals are placing higher emphasis on their health, especially food. As poke shops introduce more varieties of toppings, such as nuts and grains, demand for poke will benefit accordingly. Overall, industry revenue is expected to rise 1.6% to $2.1 billion over the five years to 2029.",

Likewise, the Hollywood Reporter reported that the number of poke locations in Los Angeles grew from 12 in 2015 to more than 200 in 2017. Some operators have exited the industry, stating that the business was not profitable enough for them to stay, and the competition has intensified over the past five years. For instance, Chicago-based FinFin Poke and New York-based Sweetcatch Poke permanently left the industry. Therefore, more industry operators are joining the industry as franchisees to minimize the risks of establishing a new brand name."

Further, many shops have followed the fast-casual model, capitalizing on the growing demand from time-strapped individuals. As inflation rises, more customers will restrict spending on food outside the home, pressuring industry demand. Nonetheless, rising health consciousness among younger individuals will counteract this decline. Profit has suffered from rising food costs. Inflation has pushed up all costs, including poke ingredients. The purchase represents the industry's largest costs. Delivery of ingredients must be prompt and reliable to avoid spoilage. Many poke shops have diversified product offerings to increase revenue. Besides poke, many shops now sell salads and soups. Poke shops have garnered interest from health enthusiasts. The low content of unhealthy ingredients in poke bowls has sparked demand from health-conscious individuals."
