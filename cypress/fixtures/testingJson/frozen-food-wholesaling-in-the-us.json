    "executive_summary": "Consumers have long viewed frozen foods as nutrient-deficient or time-saving options that are simple to prepare. Over the past five years, the Frozen Food Wholesaling industry has sought to change the former and capitalize on the latter. As consumers become increasingly busy yet remain cost-conscious, the need for convenient meals has bolstered demand for frozen food. Shifting consumer preferences are spurring product innovation, driving demand for meatless, gluten-free and organic frozen foods. Still, escalating competition is mitigating frozen food sales.",

As large manufacturers have increasingly established their own distribution divisions, merchant wholesalers have struggled to keep up. Heightened competition has squeezed sales for wholesalers who've been forced to innovate their product lines and consolidate operations."

The COVID-19 pandemic crushed restaurants and other food service establishments, leaving wholesalers without demand from this substantial market segment. Industry revenue from food service sales declined in 2020 and 2021 as a result of pandemic-related shutdowns and declining consumer demand."

Still, demand for frozen foods will remain steady as consumers continue to eat restaurant meals with frozen ingredients."
