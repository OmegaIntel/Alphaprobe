    "executive_summary": "Over the past five years, the Print Advertising Distribution industry has contracted alongside the relevance of print advertising. Expenditure on print advertising has declined during the period as digital advertising has taken over. In 2020, COVID-19 exacerbated this trend, further pushing consumers to shop, work and socialize online. Additionally, the overall macroeconomic decline associated with the coronavirus led to reductions in consumer spending and corporate profit, contributing to a decline in total advertising expenditure. Overall, IBISWorld estimates industry revenue has decreased an annualized 1.5% to $3.9 billion over the five years to 2023, including an expected 0.3% decline in 2023 alone.",
