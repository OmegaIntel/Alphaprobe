Manufacturers have benefited from largely favorable economic conditions over the last few years but haven't been exempt from the COVID-19 pandemic's disruptions and subsequent inflation. Growth in the number of businesses and corporate profit have fueled demand for promotional products since new companies use them to generate consumer awareness and favorability around their brand. In 2020, the pandemic temporarily upturned the industry's growth as the associated economic downturn and stay-at-home orders hindered spending from businesses struggling with faltering revenue. Manufacturers enjoyed a surge in revenue in 2021 as recovery pushed corporate profit through the roof. Since then, corporate profit has gone on to regress and even decline starting in 2023 amid interest rate hikes. Industry revenue is set to sink at a CAGR of 1.4% to $17.8 billion through the end of 2024, including a stumble of 0.2% in 2024 alone.",
