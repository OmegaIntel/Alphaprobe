Consumers are reducing sugar consumption as prices climb and more individuals seek healthier eating habits. The rising price of sugar boosts purchase costs for wholesalers, who are also contending with volatile diesel prices. Passing costs to downstream buyers has become increasingly tricky as vertically integrated competitors leverage economies of scale to generate lower selling prices, and health-conscious consumers view the higher cost as an incentive to continue healthier eating habits.",

Consumers have become increasingly health-conscious, becoming more aware of the negative associations with eating sugar-dense foods, like most candy, and growing increasingly concerned with highly processed foods, like most candy products."

Maintaining price-based competition is almost impossible for independent distributors unaffiliated with a candy manufacturer. Big candy brands maintain substantial loyalty, so downstream buyers are eager to have such products on their shelves. Distributors are typically unable to compete with the brands' vertically integrated distribution systems and have little maneuverability in purchasing prices since the brand has increasingly less incentive to negotiate with them."

The average wholesaler lacks the economies of scale from which vertically integrated operations benefit, so they endure far greater operational costs, forcing them to raise prices or cut into returns, a choice few larger competitors face."
