    "executive_summary": "Most products in the Pump and Compressor Manufacturing industry are used by companies in the mining, manufacturing and utility sectors. As a result, demand for pumps and compressors is often determined by a variety of economic factors. For example, oil production volumes and energy prices have a direct effect on industry revenue and profit. In addition, the industry is characterized by its extensive participation in foreign markets. In 2024, exports are estimated to represent over one-third of industry revenue, while imports satisfy almost one-half of domestic demand. Canada and Mexico are major trade partners due to their geographic proximity to the United States. China also accounts for a substantial portion of international trade, largely because of low wage costs.",

The decline is largely explained by the outbreak of COVID-19, which had a negative effect on the entire economy, with industry revenue declining 17.5% in 2020 alone. In the latter part of the current period, industry revenue has partly rebounded from the negative effects of the pandemic as the US economy experienced growth overall, but industry revenue is estimated to remain below pre-pandemic levels in 2024. Moreover, imports' share of industry revenue has also climbed due to a rising value of the US dollar and other macroeconomic factors."

This has stemmed from strong foreign competition and an appreciating US dollar. The pandemic slashed exports as international trade was constricted because of health and safety regulations. Import penetration continues to plague domestic companies since foreign manufacturers typically have lower labor costs and can price their products more competitively."

Many large manufacturers are investing more in environmentally friendly technologies, partly driven by government incentives. To get access to new technologies and expand geographically, pump and compressor manufacturers have steadily consolidated over the past five years. The most notable consolidation occurred in 2020 when Gardner Denver Holdings Inc. merged with Ingersoll Rand Industrial, bolstering the new company's presence in the industry and making it one of the largest players. M&A activity has constrained industry participation, with the number of pump and compressor manufacturers expected to fall."

Companies will face price competition and continue to make adjustments to help deter consumers away from lower-cost goods. Many end markets still prefer US-made goods because of their quality and durability. A depreciation in the US dollar will make imported goods more expensive, resulting in declining imports into the domestic market. Even so, over two-fifths of domestic demand is still set to be fulfilled by foreign pumps and compressors. Exports are set to recover as a weaker US dollar makes domestic pumps and compressors more affordable globally."

Some companies will focus on niche or sustainable products to align with ongoing trends. Investments in research and development will help create components that will help reduce energy usage. Oil-free air compressors will also see heightened popularity because of their ability to reduce waste and contamination.
