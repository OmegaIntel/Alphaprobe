    "executive_summary": "The Frozen Fruit and Juice Production industry has grown over the last few years, despite restructuring of its key product segments. This industry consists of two distinct product groups: frozen juice concentrates and frozen berries and other fruits. These two segments experienced significantly different growth trajectories over the past five years. The frozen fruit segment has benefited from rising health consciousness, new product development and expanding shelf space in freezer aisles. The rapidly growing popularity of ready-to-blend smoothie kits has helped drive demand for frozen berries and tropical fruit varieties from the household market. In contrast, the frozen juice concentrates segment has contended with an overall decline in per capita juice consumption and rising external competition from fresh juice producers. Over the past five years, industry revenue has been increasing at a CAGR of 4.4%, and is expected to reach $4.5 billion in 2023. While the COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in significant disruptions in industry trends, industry revenue has continued to rise, with a growth of 8.4% anticipated in 2023. Although fruit products contain natural and added sugars, industry operators have rebranded and reformulated goods over the past five years to cater to rising health consciousness. Producers of frozen fruit have successfully commercialized the benefits of fruit as an essential part of a healthy diet. With the help of trade associations, frozen fruit processors have also promoted the health benefits of frozen foods relative to their fresh, refrigerated or canned counterparts. In 2023, the average industry profit margin is expected to reach 2.4% of industry revenue.",

Consumer desires for healthier food options spurred demand for fruit products, leading manufacturers to focus on promoting the benefits of frozen fruit as an indispensable part of a healthy diet. The desire for quickly prepared foods has drawn consumers to frozen fruit, which can easily be added to smoothies, breakfast yogurt, oatmeal and other ready-to-eat snacks to boost their nutritional value. People's schedules have become busier, making frozen fruit more attractive in some instances than fresh fruit, which typically requires time-intensive preparation."

Industry operators prefer the flash freezing method, as it preserves the taste and fresh flavor of the fruits by locking them in a relatively nutrient-rich state. The US Food and Drug Administration and the International Food Information Council have both reported that frozen products offer the same essential nutrients and health benefits as fresh fruit."

The TWI has fluctuated and ultimately increased over the period, and despite substantial trade disruptions during the COVID-19 pandemic, imports have significantly increased in the period. Foreign producers typically use low-cost labor or less expensive inputs and are more price-competitive than domestic operators. Japan accounts for the highest share of exports; the country represents a large market for frozen and otherwise processed foods, largely due to its limited agricultural capacity."

Frozen fruit production enables consumers to enjoy their preferred fruits year-round, despite the seasonality of some produce. Rising health consciousness is likely to benefit frozen fruit producers, as new research continues to demonstrate that freezing foods preserves certain nutrients better than refrigeration or canning."
