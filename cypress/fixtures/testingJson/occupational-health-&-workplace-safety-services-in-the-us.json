    "executive_summary": "Occupational health and workplace safety specialists have performed well during the current period, but revenue has been volatile. The outbreak of COVID-19 in 2020 led to temporary shutdowns of key downstream markets, greatly reducing the number of employees and the need for occupational health and safety specialists. However, increased regulations resulting from OSHA's National Emphasis Program encouraged some downstream demand during the pandemic. As the economy reopened, commodity prices surged, leading to heightened mining and manufacturing output as companies sought to take advantage of the favorable price environment. Low interest rates led to booming residential construction activity and the need for occupational health and safety experts. This surge in demand from these downstream markets, compounded by increased productivity through technology, lowered wage costs and bolstered profit. Over the past couple of years, interest rate hikes led to slowdowns in various downstream markets and have hindered growth in 2023 and 2024.",
