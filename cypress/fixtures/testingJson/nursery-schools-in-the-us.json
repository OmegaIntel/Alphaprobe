    "executive_summary": "Figures have been adjusted for inflation and are presented in 2024 currency.\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic eliminated the need for many to seek nursery school care, leading to a significant drop in industry revenue. Government assistance through the CARES Act and the American Rescue Plan Act (ARPA) provided a lifeline to nursery schools, leading to a near-full recovery by 2021. As inflation surged in 2022, parents turned to cheaper nursery schools and alternate caregiving methods, straining prices and muting growth. Still, a rise in dual-income families and sustained government backing kept on a solid trend upward. Revenue has been climbing at a CAGR of 1.0% to an estimated $17.0 billion over the five years through 2024, including an expected 1.7% dip in 2024 alone.",

According to a Center for American Progress report, over half of all parents in the US live in a childcare \"desert,\" meaning they lack access to licensed child care. This means they have few options and little power over available nursery schools, so most have been able to pass these down through tuition hikes."

Unemployed parents can watch their kids themselves, so nursery schools are a more discretionary expense for them. Unemployment is also increasing the number of family members, friends and neighbors available to care for children, making nursery schools' top substitute more viable. Revenue will accordingly sink in 2024."

As parents' essential purchases, like groceries and utilities, became more expensive, many switched to cheaper nursery schools or relied on family, friends or neighbors for childcare. Slowing revenue growth left many nursery schools less able to handle costs like rent and wages. Nursery schools have been forced to raise wages to retain caretakers."

The Coronavirus, Aid, Recovery and Economic Security (CARES) Act somewhat tempered losses for nursery schools, but revenue still nosedived in 2020. The rollout of the American Rescue Plan Act (ARPA) helped the industry bounce back from 2020's challenges. Nearly half the industry's revenue comes from government assistance plans."
