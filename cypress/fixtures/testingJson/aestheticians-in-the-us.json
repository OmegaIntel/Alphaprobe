    "executive_summary": "A sharp incline in economic volatility, coupled with consistent growth in direct competition, has harmed aestheticians' growth over the past five years. The services offered by operators are heavily reliant on in-person consumer presence and steady disposable incomes to finance these services. Although aestheticians continue to deliver quality skincare services, the effects of COVID-19 severely harmed core revenue streams, as it forced many customers to look for at-home care options for facial maintenance. Even as consumer demand remained elevated and rebounded following the pandemic, persistent inflationary pressures severely ate into consumers' disposable incomes, forcing them to look for less expensive alternatives.",

Over the past five years, revenue fell at a CAGR of 2.3% to an estimated $3.7 billion, including an anticipated 1.8% boost in 2024. The proliferation of environmentally-friendly substances has been a vital factor in influencing consumer sentiment surrounding the overall industry, while also improving operators' sustainability efforts."

With consumers facing a mix of shaky economic conditions and growing attractiveness of at-home skincare alternatives, it has created downward pressure on operators' less expensive services like facial services and masks. The proliferation of online shopping during the pandemic, coupled with the impact of high inflation on consumers' disposable incomes, forced many customers into looking for less expensive facial alternatives, which undercut core demand streams for operators."
