While the field still lacks conclusive medical research, private insurers' growing coverage of treatments has strengthened patient access. Patients' uptake of chiropractic care has also been rising as more people seek drug-free or alternative therapies to traditional care methods. Steady growth was disrupted by the COVID-19 pandemic as patient volumes dropped, creating long care backlogs. While practices have seen patient numbers recover, cost pressures, inflation and labor shortages continue to create challenges.",

Some practices received a bump in patients as pandemic concerns subsided, with patients reporting back and neck pain from long stretches of working from beds, couches and countertops. Delayed chiropractic treatments created long backlogs of appointments in 2021, allowing chiropractic clinics to recoup pandemic losses."
