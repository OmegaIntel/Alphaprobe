Companies commonly manufacture lighting systems, electrical wiring, electrical control units, sensors, electronic ignition systems and driver displays. Auto electronics manufacturers have faltered through the current period, especially as the pandemic and high interest rates inject uncertainty into consumer markets. Revenue has ebbed at an expected CAGR of 1.6% to $26.8 billion through the current period, despite a 3.1% rebound in 2024, where profit reached 5.8%.",

Higher interest rates have also corresponded with poor consumer confidence, making individuals less willing to purchase new vehicles. Even so, consumer confidence is rebounding in 2024. This trend will contribute to stronger demand for new cars, especially as automakers take advantage of pent-up demand for travel."

The prices of most key inputs, including steel, cobalt, copper, silicon, semiconductors and rare earth metals noticeably increased, contributing to profit declines. Companies have largely prioritized supply chain localization following these disruptions. Automakers have historically relied on tier 1 suppliers, like automobile electronics manufacturers, to purchase and package chips."

However, electric vehicles require a series of advanced components to function with batteries and electric drivetrains. This shift will create ample opportunities for start-ups and other entrants but may cause companies focused on parts associated with combustion vehicles to falter."

These foreign producers offer domestic buyers high-quality, price-competitive automobile electronics. In particular, many prominent automakers have outsourced production to Mexico. Many members of the automotive supply chain will similarly relocate to Mexico to cut transportation costs and more closely collaborate with their supply chains."

Persistent foreign competition will also spur consolidation. Leading manufacturers will target competitors with strong positions in niches, especially high-tech products associated with electric vehicles.
