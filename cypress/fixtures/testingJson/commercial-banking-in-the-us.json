In 2022, the Fed began hiking interest rates after lowering them to historical lows in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Higher interest rates are reducing the overall quantity of loans issued by banks. The fewer loans are fortunately bringing higher interest income. If rates get too high, demand for loans from businesses will dip, worsening the state of the economy and the demand for commercial banks."

Freed from being stuck in a tight apartment in the city, many sought to buy houses with more space. The low interest rates to spur growth in an economic downturn made it cheap for individuals to take out mortgages. The lower mortgage rates puffed up housing prices. So, both the quantity of housing loans increased for commercial banks as well the size of each loan."

For banks, higher rates offer more interest on loans. On the other hand, volatile consumer and business sentiment, alongside an uncertain economic outlook, will pose threats to lending demand. There are tons of debt among businesses, so if rates continue increasing, the chance for defaults will increase, putting industry revenue at risk. If inflation increases, client's debt will be cheaper to pay off, but commercial banks end up receiving less real valued money vs nominal."
