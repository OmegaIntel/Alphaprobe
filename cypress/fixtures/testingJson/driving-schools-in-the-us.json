    "executive_summary": "Driving schools have seen solid growth through the current period as strong growth in the aftermath of lockdowns propelled revenue upwards. Thirty-seven states require formal driver's education to qualify for a license, though these requirements are usually lifted at 18 or 21. Driving schools face a long-term trend of adolescents delaying getting a driver's license, leading to a shrinking number of aspiring drivers required to attend a driving school. Online competitors provide a cheaper substitute for the industry for adolescents in some states, so driving school is often a discretionary purchase. Solid growth in disposable income enabled consumers to buy cars and enroll in a driver's ed course, but discretionary budgets have come back.",
