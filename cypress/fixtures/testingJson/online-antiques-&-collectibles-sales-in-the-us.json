    "executive_summary": "Figures have been adjusted for inflation and are presented in 2024 currency. Online antiques and collectibles sellers have continued to flourish, largely because of the growing ubiquity and popularity of online shopping. Antiques and collectibles are timeless yet discretionary items, making this industry sensitive to changes in disposable income. Despite steady growth, antique and collectible item sales have historically relied on brick-and-mortar stores because of the nature of the items sold. However, this was disrupted by COVID-19, as consumers shifted their preferences toward online shopping. Revenue for online antiques and collectibles sellers is expected to climb at a CAGR of 9.1% to $2.6 billion through the end of 2024, including growth of 1.6% in 2024. The strong expansion in sales has supported profit growth.",

After making an online purchase for the first time, consumers are more likely to do it again. Investors in antiques and collectibles prefer online platforms over traditional physical stores because of their lower prices and more comprehensive selections."

Disposable incomes have climbed alongside strong labor markets and general economic growth in recent years. Following the Federal Reserve's decision to aggressively raise benchmark interest rates multiple times in recent years, a tighter policy has affected budgets and caused some volatility in disposable income. Until inflation eases, the cost of living will continue to be high, affecting disposable income levels."

As the number of mobile connections continues to swell, more consumers can easily connect with online sellers. Increases in online payment security boosted this trend by making consumers feel confident in the reliability and safety of the online shopping process. Providing secure transactions is one of the primary reasons that consumers use online antiques and collectibles sellers."

Blockchain technology will help verify the authenticity of antiques and collectibles. This could reduce fraud and build greater trust between buyers and sellers.

This regulatory shift will boost operations costs, reduce profit and jeopardize the business model of online antiques and collectibles sales. Smaller companies will be hit hard, as they will need to hire tax specialists to ensure compliance, thereby increasing operational costs. Profit is already relatively modest, which could force some companies out of the industry."

Expanding globalization means a broader audience for antiques and collectibles, increasing competition while also opening up new markets.
