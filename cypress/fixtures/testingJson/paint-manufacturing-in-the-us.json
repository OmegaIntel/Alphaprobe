    "executive_summary": "The Paint Manufacturing industry provides protective and decorative finishes for a variety of downstream markets. Paint manufacturers primarily supply the Construction sector with coatings for houses and commercial buildings; the industry also supplies the Manufacturing sector with paint for products such as cars, boats, consumer goods and more. In recent years, paint and coatings manufacturing has grown despite challenges from volatile interest rates and crude oil price increases. Low interest rates in the immediate aftermath of the pandemic spurred on new construction while industrial customers capitalized on improved supply chains and customer demand to ramp up production. Industry revenue has grown at a CAGR of 1.1% and is expected to reach a total of $33.7 billion in 2024 as revenue rises by an estimated 0.7%.",
