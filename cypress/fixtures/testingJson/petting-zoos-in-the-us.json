    "executive_summary": "The petting zoo industry mainly provides public and private petting zoo experiences to people of all ages. Over the years to 2024, industry performance was impacted by macroeconomic conditions like declining unemployment and increasing disposable income. The industry experienced volatility due to COVID-19, causing temporary closures and visitor limits. Revenue grew at a CAGR of 3.8% to $107.2 million over the last few years, with an estimated 0.8% increase in 2024. Though private funding increased, government funding remains minimal, requiring operators to sell high-profit products. Profit has been volatile in 2024 but is not expected to fully recover to pre-pandemic levels.",
