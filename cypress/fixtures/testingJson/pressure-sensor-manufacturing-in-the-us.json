In particular, the application of microelectromechanical (MEMS) pressure sensors, which have advanced microprocessors and electrical components that permit greater functionality and efficiency in a smaller, cost-effective design, has been a key revenue driver. However, drops in demand from the vehicle manufacturing sector, the largest buyer of pressure sensors, led to losses the industry has yet to fully recover from. Still, revenue is estimated to hike at a CAGR of 2.3% to $2.0 billion through the end of 2024, including an expected 2.0% gain in 2024 alone.",
