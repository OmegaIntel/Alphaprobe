As homelessness increases, industry revenue will increase if the homeless seek housing services over unsheltered alternatives. COVID-19 shocked employment, housing prices and poverty rates, leading to housing instability and government action, fostering industry-wide revenue growth at a CAGR of 3.1% to $19.6 billion over the five years to 2023.
