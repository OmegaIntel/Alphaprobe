    "executive_summary": "These typically fast-casual restaurants wed the quality and taste of full-service establishments with the speed and affordability of fast-food chains. Also, health-conscious and customizable options on bakeries' menus have attracted more customers. Industry performance has been supported by overall per capita disposable income and consumer spending growth. Nonetheless, the COVID-19 (coronavirus) pandemic resulted in a setback for industry growth as consumers began to cut discretionary spending and limit unnecessary time spent in public. Overall, industry revenue has remained at $17.1 billion over the past five years, including an increase of 0.8% in 2023 alone.",

The JAB Holding Company (JAB) has pursued a rigorous merger and acquisition strategy during this period. The company has acquired Bruegger's Enterprises Inc., the Panera Bread Company and ABP Corporation. Each group operates under the franchise model, facilitating the rapid growth of small, independently operated establishments under widely recognized brand names."

Cafes with specialized menu items like French pastries, including macaroons, brioches and croissants, have been especially prominent. The gourmet cupcake trend has been part of this trend, with the number of stores rising steadily over the past decade."

To avoid price-based competition and to protect profit, these stores will target markets with more significant potential for growth like the breakfast crowd."

However, these products rarely matched the quality and convenience of a bakery loaf. As indoor dining restrictions were lifted, bakeries focused on their holistic experience: the smell of baked goods, a personal connection to a local baker and cafe staff, the community of a pleasant coworking space and a diverse range of unique creations that are difficult to match at home."

Panera's parent company, JAB Holdings, will gain an increased market share by investing in its bakery and caf\u00e9 chains portfolio. Franchise agreements, the preferred business model most major chains use, enable cafe chains to open many new locations with limited capital investment and lower risk. Independent bakery-cafes will only compete if they have a defined target market, a loyal customer base and a solid local reputation."

While this will remain bakery cafes' most lucrative time, many will aggressively target the underserviced breakfast and dinner market, helping them avoid price-based competition. Chains like Einstein Bros. and Corner Bakery Cafe have already introduced breakfast sandwiches and prioritize the morning crowd, including healthy breakfast alternatives like granola, fruit and yogurt on their menus. Traditionally, breakfast is mostly consumed at home, but consumers will increasingly eat out for their first meal as consumer spending and confidence grows. By offering dinner items, bakery cafes siphon away consumers from traditional sit-down restaurants typically visited for dinner."

If demand remains strong, bakery cafes can raise prices if input costs inflate. Still, the relatively low cost of many baked goods ingredients helps keep revenue higher than other dining-out segments."

This would not only give customers a unique in-store experience but also support batch pre-orders to guarantee revenue. Providing behind-the-scenes tours can show customers how their favorite products are made, give them an appreciation for the baking process and strengthen their connection with the brand. Pop-up events or collaborations with local chefs, artists, or other businesses can create a buzz and attract new customers without much capital investment. These events could include limited-edition products, working with celebrities, or community activities that link an already pleasant experience with the taste of freshly baked goods."
