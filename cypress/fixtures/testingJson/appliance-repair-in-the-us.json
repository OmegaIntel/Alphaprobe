    "executive_summary": "In recent years, appliance repair businesses have experienced mixed performance metrics, reflecting the challenges and opportunities shaped by external economic forces. At the early stage of the pandemic, the industry took a hit on the revenue, driven by low homeownership rates, weak existing home sales and shaky consumer confidence. As the economy began to rebound, some workers still chose to work from home, spurring demand for new appliances. Yet, supply chain disruptions complicate matters, delaying the availability of new appliances and the necessary repair parts and highlighting the need for repair services.",

However, these factors also influence wages, which are a significant expense in the industry, resulting in a relatively stable profit. Volatile economic conditions in recent years, driven by the pandemic and its recovery, caused revenue to rise at an estimated CAGR of 1.9% over the past five years. It is expected to total $6.5 billion in 2024, falling an estimated 1.0% that year alone."

            "current_performance_point_description": "Many consumers consider budget when deciding whether to repair or replace an appliance. As per capita disposable income increases, consumers are more likely to buy new appliances rather than fix their existing ones. High interest rates in recent years have deterred consumers from buying new household appliances, particularly large ones like refrigerators and dryers, which are often purchased on credit. Instead, consumers prefer repairing existing units. Repair workers should account for replacement costs and consumer budgets when pricing repairs, balancing service costs against the potential revenue generated."

However, rising appliance prices and higher unemployment rates will likely shift decisions toward repair over replacement.

People can always switch to lower-price companies or substitutes like DIY repair. Right to Repair laws require manufacturers to make their parts, tools and service information available to appliance repairers. The legislation will strengthen the ability of repairers to provide services, but prevalent DIY products will challenge revenue. The expansion in the number of establishments will keep pace with the increase in enterprises, indicating a relatively stable and saturated industry structure."

Shifts in consumer preference will also reduce the need for labor investment. As wages constitute a significant portion of the cost structure, this reduction will lower costs, allowing profit to remain steady despite declining revenue. Despite global supply chain issues caused by increased international tensions, purchase costs will remain a relatively small portion of overall revenue, minimally impacting profit."
