A long-term shift in consumer perceptions has underpinned growth as mainstream consumers increasingly accept psychic services. Traditional skepticism about consulting psychics has waned, with more consumers embracing these services, especially in times of uncertainty. The pandemic significantly boosted demand for services as many turned to spiritual guidance to navigate their anxieties about health, finances and the loss of loved ones. This uptick reflects a broader trend towards personalized and spiritual approaches to life's challenges, making psychic services a more mainstream part of many people's lives. Revenue expanded at a CAGR of 4.3% over the years to 2024 to $2.3 billion, including a growth of 0.7% in 2024.",
