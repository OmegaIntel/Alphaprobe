    "executive_summary": "Automobile interior manufacturers primarily produce seats, safety belts and other interior products for automobile and other transportation manufacturers. The industry's performance closely relates to the automotive industry as many companies rely on supply contracts with automakers. The pandemic largely drove manufacturers' decline through the current period, destabilizing supply chains and altering consumer behavior. Lockdown restrictions prevented travel, while poor economic conditions discouraged new car purchases, limiting demand for automobile interiors. Manufacturers have slowly recovered from the pandemic, taking advantage of climbing new sales, though manufacturers have struggled to match pre-pandemic revenue and profit figures. Overall, revenue has plummeted at an expected CAGR of 3.7% to $28.8 billion through the current period, despite a 1.2% jump in 2024, where profit rebounded to 2.3%.",
