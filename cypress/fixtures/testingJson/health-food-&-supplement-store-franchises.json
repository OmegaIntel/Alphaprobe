    "executive_summary": "The Health Food and Supplement Store Franchises industry has expanded, albeit modestly, over the five years to 2022. During the period, health-conscious consumers have increasingly purchased alternative medicines and natural remedies that have not been traditionally available at retail stores. Moreover, increasing awareness of the benefits of industry products provides a lucrative and expanding market for franchises. In light of the COVID-19 pandemic, industry franchises have benefited from increased sales of nutritional supplements and vitamins, as consumers seek ways to boost immunity for themselves and family. Still, rising competition over the past five years from e-tailers and big-box stores has tempered industry growth. In all, industry revenue is expected to increase an annualized 1.3% to $824.8 million over the five years to 2022, including 0.5% growth in 2022 alone.",
