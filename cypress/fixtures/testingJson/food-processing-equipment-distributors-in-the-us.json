    "executive_summary": "Food processing equipment distributors have endured moderate volatility in recent years. The 2020 pandemic led to significant revenue losses because many downstream food companies had to pause or close operations to limit the spread of the virus. As the economy reopened, distributors' revenue grew amid more companies re-entering the industry and consumers buying more products because of their pent-up demand. An overheating economy led to swelling inflation, which harmed disposable income and pushed consumers to buy just the necessities, placing downward pressure on revenue.",
