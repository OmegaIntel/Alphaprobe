    "executive_summary": "Companies in this Companies in the ATV Rentals and Tour Services industry rent all-terrain vehicles (ATV) and equipment for recreational use. Many companies also offer guided tours on ATVs. Through the end of 2024, rising disposable income and growth in downstream markets have spurred demand for social events and discretionary activities. However, the COVID-19 pandemic significantly hindered demand as large gatherings were prohibited to prevent the virus spread. Nonessential businesses were forced to close down and consumers allocated their funds toward the necessities. Nonetheless, pent-up consumer demand following the containment of the pandemic enabled the industry to rapidly recover, effectively offsetting prior losses.",

Many companies also offer guided tours on ATVs. Since these products are discretionary, product demand depends on disposable income.

Amid the economic recovery following the pandemic in 2021, the industry became more competitive as low barriers to entry and a relatively high profit margin induced many new companies to enter the marketplace."

When consumers are optimistic about future economic conditions, they are more willing to make a purchase. Also, when consumers have more leisure time, they are more likely to rent ATVs for recreational purposes. The industry has benefited from improving economic conditions over the five years to 2024."

This was due to government-mandated stay-at-home orders and nonessential business restrictions, which effectively stunted demand from downstream markets. As the pandemic slowed down, many state governments eased business restrictions, permitting ATV rental and tour service companies to resume normal operating conditions."

After the COVID-19 pandemic began, demand for ATV rentals and tour services declined as the economy entered a downturn, resulting in many individuals losing their jobs. Due to poor macroeconomic conditions, industry profit sharply decreased in 2020 and has yet to reach pre-pandemic levels, despite recovering demand."

Despite heightened inflationary pressures, steady growth in disposable income and a strong desire to attend social events will accelerate the need for ATV rental and tour services. Nonetheless, consumers may be more selective in their options, particularly as expansion of online services will create more affordable alternate options and this could potentially dampen further revenue growth."
