    "executive_summary": "Beer, wine and liquor stores have remained in high spirits over the past five years despite some uncharacteristic volatility. A rise in disposable income levels has boosted sales of high-margin and imported beverages, typically less available at alternative retailers. Consumer preferences have shifted away from popular global beer brands to local craft styles with high-quality ingredients and higher profit margins. A rise in e-commerce has encouraged many stores to incorporate online orders and delivery, boosting sales among younger demographics. Over the past five years, revenue for beer, wine and liquor stores has been expanding at a CAGR of 2.2% and is expected to rise 2.9% in 2024 alone, when sales will reach $79.9 billion.",
