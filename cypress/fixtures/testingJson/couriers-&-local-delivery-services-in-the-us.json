Corporate profit has surged in the years following the pandemic, boosting demand for business-to-business shipments. Although the world price of crude oil sharply increased in 2022 after Russia invaded Ukraine, it has since declined, decreasing operation costs for this industry. A recent oil production halt in Saudi Arabia have the potential to harm industry operations through the end of 2023. While oil prices have steadily declined after 2021, this move may cause them to spike again."

More specifically, both large and small companies have made a push to serve the healthcare market. Many healthcare products including pharmaceutical companies are required to maintain a specific temperature range to maintain integrity. Therefore, couriers tailoring services to the healthcare industry must ensure that vehicles are equipped with the proper temperature control vehicles, and the delivery workers are well trained. In September of 2023, UPS announced its acquisition of MNX Global Logistics (MNX). This greatly expands UPS's capabilities both domestically and internationally. This acquisition is expected to further squeeze competition in the US in the healthcare courier industry since UPS already takes up a large portion of activity."

Similarly, in the corporate sector as the number of businesses increases, along with corporate profit, the volume of deliveries should rise.
