    "executive_summary": "Over the five years to 2024, the Horse Training Services industry has seen a slight overall decline in revenue, falling at an expected CAGR of 0.4% to reach an estimated $304.2 million in 2024. This decline stems from the hit horse trainers took from the COVID-19 pandemic; many horse shows and races were cancelled in order to comply with safety requirements, particularly in 2020. This limited demand for horse training. Still, at the same time, the recreational market, which accounts for more than 50.0% of industry revenue, sustained demand for industry services as growth in per capita disposable boosted expenditure on horse training and boarding. Falling per capita disposable income in 2022 and an inflationary period is expected to have contributed to a slight decline in demand in that year alone.",
