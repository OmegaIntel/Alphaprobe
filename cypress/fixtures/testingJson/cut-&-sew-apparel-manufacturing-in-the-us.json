            "question": "Does your company specialize in a niche, or do you produce a diversified range of products?",
            "answer": "To offset price-based import competition, companies within the industry have narrowed their product mix and specialized in higher value-added products. The growing economic uncertainty lowers demand for premium items as consumers favor more affordable manufacturers."
        },
        {
            "question": "Are your company's sales heavily dependent on the health of the US economy?",
            "answer": "While a strong US economy certainly helps aid revenue, other factors, like import penetration and input prices, impact revenue. The US dollar's strength directly impacts domestic consumption, as a strong dollar pushes consumers toward imported apparel."
        },
        {
            "question": "Have you looked into setting up manufacturing facilities in lower-wage regions of the country or places with less stringent regulations?",
            "answer": "The industry's labor costs are significant; companies may opt to relocate to areas where they face lower labor costs to minimize production costs and bolster profit. As states now have varying regulations regarding work safety and what facilities can be open, establishing operations elsewhere in response to idling facilities in more regulated regions may be key to success among price-sensitive consumers."
        },
        {
            "question": "Has your company been exposed to volatile input prices?",
            "answer": "Cotton is a main input in many apparel manufacturing processes. Fluctuations in the price of cotton significantly impact manufacturers' profits."
        },
        {
            "question": "Have you been able to reduce reliance on labor through automation?",
            "answer": "Processes like cutting and sewing require precise manual labor, and many activities are difficult to automate because clothing styles vary each season and consumer preferences are constantly changing. The detailed features that add value to these more expensive products are often hand-made, making it a more labor-intense than technology-intense process."
        },
        {
            "question": "Is your company investing in technology, like online portals and marketplaces, to establish a competitive edge and maintain client connections?",
            "answer": "Because of high price-based competition, companies seek new ways to remain competitive. Consumers have been gravitating towards online shopping. Manufacturers seeking to reach a broader customer base must invest in online portals to adapt to shifting consumer shopping preferences."

        {
            "question": "How has your company's profit and growth compared to your main competitors?",
            "answer": "Given the presence of competitively priced imports in the domestic market, companies face high pressure from downstream buyers to lower selling prices. Like most clothing industries, companies compete based largely on price and falling consumer sentiment has spurred many losses as companies compete for this reduced demand."
        },
        {
            "question": "Do you monitor the consumer confidence index? How can you adapt as the consumer confidence index declines amid growing economic uncertainty?",
            "answer": "When consumers are feeling more confident about their finances and the state of the US economy, they generally buy goods in larger quantities and spend more on luxury or discretionary items, driving demand for new apparel. The growing sentiment of uncertainty lowers sales, as consumers purchase fewer clothing unless necessary. During times of economic uncertainty, offering lower prices enables manufacturers to appeal to a broader consumer pool."
