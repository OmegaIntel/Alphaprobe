In the event of an allegation of negligence or a lawsuit, medical malpractice insurance covers expenses relating to defense attorney fees, court costs and settlements. Insurers can provide these services at a fraction of the potential loss by pooling premiums to pay for losses that some policyholders incur. Accordingly, the industry is an indispensable part of risk management for the overall healthcare industry.",
