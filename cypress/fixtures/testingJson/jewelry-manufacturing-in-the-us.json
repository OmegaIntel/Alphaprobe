    "executive_summary": "Jewelry manufacturers produce jewelry items or silverware using precious or semiprecious metals and stones. Jewelry sales are largely discretionary in nature. Luxury and custom jewelry items are dependent on downstream demand from consumers. Per capita disposable income has increased in recent years, although these increases did not translate to higher demand in 2020, mainly due to increasing uncertainty. Similarly, the global price of gold and silver skyrocketed since the pandemic, with jewelry prices following closely. Manufacturers are characterized by significant price competition, resulting in falling demand amid higher prices. These factors have led to jewelry manufacturing revenue falling at an estimated CAGR of 2.3% to $21.4 billion through 2024, including a 2.4% dip that year alone.",
