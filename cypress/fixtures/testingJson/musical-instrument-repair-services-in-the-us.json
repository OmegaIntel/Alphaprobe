    "executive_summary": "The Musical Instrument Repair Services Industry performance typically runs countercyclical to poor economic conditions, as many consumers substitute purchases with repairs during periods of economic uncertainty. However, the growth was disrupted by the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020. Pandemic-related restrictions temporarily shuttered instrument repair shops and many consumers hesitated to seek in-person services because of safety concerns. The cancellation of concerts and the shift to remote learning environments deepened the drop in demand as professional musicians and schools represent major markets. However, as restrictions were lifted, demand for musical repairs improved during the latter half of the current period. The number of people playing musical instruments because of pandemic-related lockdowns has expanded the industry's customer base.",
