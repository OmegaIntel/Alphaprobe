    "executive_summary": "Indoor marble contractors have endured severe uncertainty through the current period following extreme volatility in construction markets. In particular, nonresidential markets plummeted amid work-from-home and lockdown orders from federal, state and local governments. Business sentiment and corporate profit plummeted, limiting private investment. Even so, the pandemic was a boon for residential markets; fewer spending options, stimulus checks and more time at home led to greater savings, encouraging many to purchase new homes or renovate existing residences and leading to solid growth through the pandemic. Even so, climbing interest rates have slammed residential and nonresidential markets alike. Businesses and homeowners alike have remained hesitant to purchase and renovate new properties.",

Many contractors lost a major revenue source during the pandemic, forcing them to refocus on more profitable segments, like residential markets. In comparison, residential markets experienced a perfect storm of positive trends, enabling this market to overachieve expectations during the pandemic. Housing starts and existing home sales climbed, aided by near-zero mortgage rates."

            "current_performance_point_description": "Despite strong growth during the pandemic, climbing interest rates and skyrocketing inflation have discouraged potential buyers from spending on new construction and renovations. Consumers are more likely to forgo major investments and save. Additionally, governments have lifted stay-at-home orders, shifting consumer focus away from their homes and home improvement, causing residential markets to plummet. At the same time, lifting restrictions have benefitted nonresidential markets, creating greater demand for offices to accommodate returning employees alongside greater demand for hotels, restaurants and other travel activities."

Specifically, marble is heavy and difficult to transport, so securing long-term contracts with nearby suppliers is a good way for companies to preserve long-term profit and provide stability. Heightened local competition, especially as marble substitutes become more popular, alongside prolonged supply chain challenges have posed major threats to indoor marble contractors, especially local nonemployers."

Climbing corporate profit and business sentiment will encourage businesses, especially accommodation-related establishments to invest in upgrades. Similarly, rising per capita disposable income and rebounding consumer confidence will lead to stability within household markets, particularly among single-family households.
