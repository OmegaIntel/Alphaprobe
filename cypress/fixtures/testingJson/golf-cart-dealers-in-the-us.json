Sales of golf carts from dealers have experienced an upswing due to an increase in leisure activities like golf. With a rise in incomes, electric golf carts are becoming the choice of many, particularly younger customers, indicating a promising market potential. This trend is mainly attributed to the broader acceptance of golf carts as neighborhood electric vehicles. However, the COVID-19 pandemic has posed fierce challenges, causing disruption in the entire supply chain from manufacturers to dealers.",

This shift has enabled dealers to expand beyond traditional consumer bases. The current period has seen an increase in leisure activities, particularly golf, thanks to more spare time and disposable income. This trend has resulted in an increased demand for golf carts.

Dealers that can provide a wider range of comfortable electric or solar-powered carts will reap stronger demand, leading to revenue and profit growth. Currently, most electric carts manage three to five horsepower, while gas-powered carts can reach twelve horsepower. However, technological improvements from manufacturers will support golf cart dealers. For example, the newest 48-volt carts from Club Car can reach 10.0 horsepower. The transition among golf carts, businesses and consumers to electric-powered carts represents a major opportunity for golf cart dealers. Companies that prioritize eco-friendly inventories will gain traction through the outlook period."
