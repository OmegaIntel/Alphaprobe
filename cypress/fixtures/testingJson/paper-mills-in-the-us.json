Heightened foreign competition from industry frontrunners and developing economies \u2013 which can produce and export at lower costs \u2013 plus a persistent decline in downstream demand for paper and paper products have hindered the industry in recent years. Paper Mills industry revenue has plummeted at a CAGR of 5.2% over the past five years and is expected to total $34.6 billion in 2024, when revenue will fall by an estimated 6.8%.",

Similarly, exports will grow more affordable; nations with strong or growing manufacturing sectors, like Mexico or India, will benefit the most from this trend."
