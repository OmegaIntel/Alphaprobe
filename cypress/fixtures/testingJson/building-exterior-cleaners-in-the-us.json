    "executive_summary": "Building exterior cleaners have performed well in recent years, but revenue growth has been volatile. As wage growth soared in the late 2010s, household income increased. Since individuals had more money, they spent more on home improvements, raising demand for building exterior cleaners. COVID-19 caused corporate profit to plunge, resulting in reduced nonresidential construction and falling revenue. Consumer spending soared as the economy recovered from the pandemic, boosting demand for building exterior cleaning services from the residential and nonresidential sectors.",

            "current_performance_point_description": "The US economy was very strong in the late 2010s because the United States was at the end of an expansion that began immediately following the 2008 financial crisis. High GDP growth contributed to rising wages and record-low unemployment. Higher wages pushed up per capita disposable income and increased the percentage of households making more than $100,000 per year, so individuals had more funds to improve their homes."

            "current_performance_point_description": "As COVID-19 ravaged the country, state and local governments shut down businesses, causing a significant drop in consumer spending. Since households weren't going to stores anymore, corporate profit plunged. Low corporate profit forced businesses to spend less on the construction and improvement of the buildings they owned (e.g., offices, department stores), reducing downstream demand for building exterior cleaners."

The government gave out wads of cash during the pandemic, so when Americans could go out again, consumer demand skyrocketed."

            "current_performance_point_description": "Expansive monetary policy, excessive government spending and supply chain disruptions caused inflation to reach record-highs in 2022. To combat high inflation, the Federal Reserve has been increasing interest rates. Higher rates make it more expensive to purchase homes. Since fewer residences are being purchased, demand for building exterior services has slowed."

Steadily rising GDP will boost corporate profit, giving businesses the funds to invest in nonresidential structures and internal improvements. Since these businesses have more places to look after, they'll pay building exterior cleaning companies to ensure their establishments look presentable to their customers, increasing revenue for the industry."

While interest rates aren't anticipated to decline by that much, consumers will adapt to the higher cost of borrowing during the outlook period, causing homebuying to recover. Since more individuals will purchase property, demand for building exterior cleaners from households will expand, contributing to solid revenue growth during the outlook period."

Entry into the industry will also be spurred by increased technological progress."

Oil and gas prices that are too high often constrain revenue for the industry since businesses and households simply choose to clean their structures themselves when prices are too high. As supply chain disruptions and shocks from the conflict in Ukraine subside, oil prices will fall, reducing these surcharges and eliminating a significant revenue stream for the industry."
