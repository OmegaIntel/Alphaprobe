    "executive_summary": "Art and office supply manufacturers have contended with stark challenges. The growing number of businesses moving operations online has negatively impacted office supply sales. During the initial stages of the pandemic, many downstream businesses were required to pause operations, negatively impacting demand for art and office supplies. During this time, many companies moved toward online, paperless communication, a trend that spilled over into the following years. Although the economic recovery enabled demand to grow, these gains could not mitigate the pandemic-related losses. These trends have resulted in revenue dropping at an estimated CAGR of 3.4% to $3.3 billion through 2024, including a 0.6% gain that year alone.",

            "question": "Are your company's sales heavily dependent on the health of the US economy?",
            "answer": "Demand for art and office supplies is not a major factor in manufacturers' performance. The slow growth of the industry can be attributed more to competition from abroad than macroeconomic events. Manufacturers are increasingly opting to move operations overseas as a cost-saving measure, a trend that harms domestic production."
        },
        {
            "question": "Have export opportunities offered an opportunity for your company?",
            "answer": "While some US manufacturing industries offer value-added products that other countries cannot offer, companies across the world in this industry generally offer the same type of product. Domestic manufacturers benefit from the perceived higher quality of domestic art and office supplies, although this does little to persuade cost-conscious consumers."
        },
        {
            "question": "Is your company investing heavily in R&D to meet changing consumer preferences?",
            "answer": "This industry is not rapidly changing and consumers are generally not demanding new types of products. Little product innovation results in lower research and development expenses than in industries undergoing rapid change."
        },
        {
            "question": "Is your company located in proximity to important suppliers?",
            "answer": "The industry's main buyers are wholesalers and retailers throughout the country. While there is not one central location that is ideal for the industry to be located in or near, companies should be located near their largest buyers in order to decrease transport costs."
        },
        {
            "question": "Have you been able to reduce wage costs by automating operations over the past five years?",
            "answer": "While automation may not fully replace humans anytime soon, companies should seek to invest in robots to save on labor expenses and create a more streamlined and efficient process."
        },
        {
            "question": "How is your company leveraging new technology in its operations?",
            "answer": "New technology, including blockchain, is used by companies to create a more streamlined production process. Everything from manufacturing to distribution to recalls may be more efficiently controlled using new technology."
        },
        {
            "question": "What effect have international tariffs had on your ability to import and export products?",
            "answer": "Tariff makes imported products more expensive in an effort to encourage consumers to purchase domestically-produced products. Low operating costs overseas can enable foreign manufacturers to charge lower prices, sometimes offsetting the cost of tariffs."
        },
        {
            "question": "Have you had any regulatory expenses that have significantly affected profitability recently?",
            "answer": "There are few formal regulatory barriers that affect manufacturers' financial situation. Regulation is generally more granular, affecting manufacturing sectors as a whole instead of this industry in particular."
        },
        {
            "question": "How does your company's inventory turnover compare to major competitors?",
            "answer": "Unlike in other industries, products produced by industry companies have a long shelf life. As a result, if a company needs to hold on to a particular product longer than expected, there should not be any more of a challenge to sell it later."
        },
        {
            "question": "Do you have any challenges with customers paying on time?",
            "answer": "Downstream buyers are generally wholesalers or retailers, not consumers. Manufacturers may offer payment plans as encouragement, especially for large orders and reputable companies."
        },
        {
            "question": "Ability to pass on cost increases",
            "answer": "Rising input prices can cause a rise in the price of office supplies. A company that can pass these increases on to downstream wholesalers and retailers can maintain profit levels. However, this is becoming increasingly difficult as large retailers like Walmart take up greater portions of the downstream market, giving it more power in price negotiations."
        },
        {
            "question": "Access to niche markets",
            "answer": "A degree of specialization within a company can provide access to niche markets, such as erasable markers. Serving niche markets enables manufacturers to develop patents and reduce revenue volatility over time as a loyal customer base is built up."
        },
        {
            "question": "Establishment of brand names",
            "answer": "In a market where many products have similar functionality and prices are under pressure, the ability to differentiate via branding can help gain market share and relieve margin pressure."
        },
        {
            "question": "How much of your sales are from online channels? How does rising online activity affect demand for your products?",
            "answer": "The internet, along with computers and printers, has reduced demand for art and office supplies as more business operations and creative processes are performed and stored on computers and through the internet. Retailers are shifting more towards online sales of these products, which is expected to continue."
        },
        {
            "question": "Do you monitor the trade-weighted index? How do you take advantage when the trade-weighted index decreases?",
            "answer": "Domestic manufacturers benefit from a weak US dollar, partly through an increase in demand for exports and partly through weaker import competition. Manufacturers must consider other factors, including trade conditions, when planning export strategy."
        },
        {
            "question": "How have current levels of demand from office supply stores affected your company? Are certain products more heavily affected when demand from office supply stores fluctuates?",
            "answer": "The majority of art and office supplies that manufacturers produce are sold to end customers through the retail sector. Activity in office supply stores is important to manufacturers because it indicates changes in demand for art and office supplies."
