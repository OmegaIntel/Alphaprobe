These conditions caused consumer confidence to skyrocket, so people were more willing to make risky investments in horse racing, which increased producers' revenue. During COVID-19, the federal government gave Americans massive amounts of aid. Consumers spent more on horses, which boosted revenue for producers.\n\nRising interest rates have fostered recessionary fears, as a higher cost of borrowing has the potential to bring the economy to a halt. Recessionary fears have reduced consumer confidence, causing spending on horses for many equestrian activities to plunge. This has resulted in falling revenue in 2021 and 2022. COVID-19, disrupted supply chains and the appreciating dollar have caused exports to decline, reducing a significant revenue stream for horse and other equine producers. Overall, revenue for horse and other equine producers is anticipated to creep upward at a CAGR of 0.6% during the current period, reaching $1.8 billion in 2023. Revenue is anticipated to rise 2.0% in that same year.",

            "question": "Were your sales particularly volatile during COVID-19?",
            "answer": "Demand for horses tends to be most dependent on disposable income levels, as they are considered a luxury good. Consumers will slow the purchase of horses during tough economic times and increase purchases during favorable economic conditions. Racing revenue declined sharply because of disruption and postponement during the pandemic."
        },
        {
            "question": "How does your company hedge against price loss risk?",
            "answer": "Diversified producers will exhibit lower degrees of revenue volatility, aiding profitability. By switching cropping activities, livestock farmers can plan what they wish to produce for the next foaling season. The LIP benefits livestock farmers when their animals die in excess because of adverse weather events or attacks by animals introduced into the wild by the Federal Government. The pandemic caused Congress to pass the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP), which enabled companies to receive forgivable loans from the federal government to pay for lost wages and rents because of social distancing regulations and quarantines. Since horse racing, showing and other equine activities were severely restricted during COVID-19, horse farmers displayed plunging revenue. Many producers took advantage of PPP loans to recuperate these losses."

Artificial insemination technologies can enhance breeding efficiency and protect stallions. With the Federal Aviation Administration's legalization of commercial drone usage, monitoring herds has never been easier. Drones for commercial use present a wide array of applications and can save on labor costs."
