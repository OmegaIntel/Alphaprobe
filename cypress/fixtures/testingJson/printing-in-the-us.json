The largest markets, advertising and publishing, have shifted online, reducing printing demand. Corporate profit declines and higher interest rates have caused advertising expenditure to plummet. Other products like retail catalogs and banking forms have also seen low demand due to e-commerce and online financial transactions. These trends have caused revenue to fall at a CAGR of 1.1% to an estimated $90.3 billion over the past five years, including an estimated 3.0% slump in 2024. Higher input costs and the shift to digital have also harmed profit for printing services.",
