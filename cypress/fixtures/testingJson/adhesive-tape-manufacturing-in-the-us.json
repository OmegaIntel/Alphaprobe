    "executive_summary": "Adhesive Tape Manufacturers produce various adhesive tapes for use across many industries, including office tape, rubber electrical tape, box-sealing tape and reflective road marking tape. Demand for adhesive tape products relies heavily on the health of downstream industries, including construction in manufacturing. The recent slowdown in demand for construction, mainly driven by weak commercial real estate performance, elevated inflation and high interest rates, has caused demand for tape products to shrink. Similarly, some of these factors have led to weaker disposable income, lowering discretionary spending and causing demand from the manufacturing sector to slow down. Although tape producers benefited from a spike in demand in 2021, unfavorable economic conditions caused revenue to continue declining. These trends are estimated to cause revenue to shrink at a CAGR of 0.5% to $248.6 million over the five years to 2023, including a 1.4% dip in 2023 alone.",

            "current_performance_point_description": "Adhesive tape is used broadly by many downstream manufacturing industries, including paper, office stationery resellers and any company offering shipping services to consumers. When economic conditions weaken, demand for discretionary purchases weakens, negatively impacting tape consumption. Elevated inflation over recent years has caused disposable income to fall, harming spending on premium purchases. As consumers lower discretionary spending, companies often follow and lower production. Weaker economic conditions also result in slower e-commerce activity, lowering the need for tape products. The healthcare sector has increased its use of adhesive tape over recent years, which became more popular during the pandemic, enabling revenue to expand in 2021."

Growing demand for construction project boost specialized tape sales. The pandemic directly impacted the construction sector, as nonresidential construction took a direct hit from strict stay-at-home orders. Although the residential sector expanded during the initial stages of the pandemic because of historically low interest rates, recent interest rate hikes and uncertain economic conditions have led to weaker demand for residential construction. The falling overall value of construction has caused adhesive tape sales to weaken, a trend that has been enhanced by elevated inflation and rising borrowing costs."

            "current_performance_point_description": "Adhesive tape producers face intense competition from foreign manufacturers that benefit from lower labor costs and thus can offer competitive prices. Domestic producers that moved production offshore have further augmented this competition. The rising value of the US dollar has created room for imports to satisfy a greater portion of domestic demand. However, well-established producers with strong brand recognition and high-quality products have boosted demand for domestic tape both internally and among foreign markets. The impact of the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) on adhesive tape producers has been expanding. Imports and exports from Mexico and Canada, the two countries that benefit from the USMCA, have expanded rapidly, causing trade to become a more prominent threat to domestic producers and creating new opportunities for exporting companies."

Over the coming years, interest rates are expected to stabilize as the Federal Reserve reaches its inflation target. This will lead to more confident consumers, which boosts demand for construction projects. With workers increasingly returning to the office and the value of construction on the rise, demand for tape products is likely to swell. Elevated mortgages can negatively impact demand from the construction sector, as it might slow down the residential sector, potentially slowing down demand for tape producers in the years to come."
