    "executive_summary": "The property and casualty insurance industry provides risk management services by pooling premiums to pay for losses incurred by policyholders. It is an essential part of the domestic economy. Insurers derive income from premiums and investing assets. Most premiums come from renewing existing policies. Changes in risk exposure and pricing affect remaining premiums. Over the past five years, revenue grew at a 1.8% CAGR to $888 billion, with a 0.7% increase expected in 2023. Profit is projected to reach 13.1% of revenue in 2023, up from 11.9% in 2018. Revenue benefited from a hardening price cycle and increased home purchases during the pandemic.",
