The pandemic outbreak negatively impacted dredging companies, as many had to halt operations because of outbreaks on vessels, making it challenging to satisfy the time constraints of contractual obligations. Federal funding for infrastructure projects has supported the industry, as dredging companies help maintain the expansive coastlines across the US. Revenue for dredging services is expected to climb at a CAGR of 0.8% to $4.6 billion through the end of 2024, including revenue growth of 1.6% in 2024. Profit has dipped recently as labor shortages pushed up wage costs and inflationary pressures increased operational costs.",

        {
            "question": "Are your company's sales heavily dependent on the health of the overall economy?",
            "answer": "International trade is the largest driver of demand for dredging services. Exchange rates will determine the level of international trade and thus demand for dredging services."
        },
        {
            "question": "How do levels of international trade affect your operations?",
            "answer": "As international trade activity accelerates, demand for industry services will climb because ports and harbors must be dredged. An estimated 70.0% of US exports and 75.0% of US imports pass through the nation's ports."

        },
        {
            "question": "How are your operations affected by the changing technological landscape?",
            "answer": "Dredging contractors who employ the latest technologies will exhibit higher operating efficiencies and wider profit margins. More fuel-efficient dredging equipment will reduce a contractor's purchase costs, boosting profitability."
        },
        {
            "question": "Have you been able to reduce wage costs through technological adoption?",
            "answer": "Dredging companies that adopt the latest technologies will save on labor costs. Dredging requires many specialized employees, and technology can trim wage bills and help retain skilled employees."
        },
        {
            "question": "How are your operations affected by the shifting regulatory landscape?",
            "answer": "Appropriations for the US Army Corps of Engineers are allocated annually as part of the White House Discretionary Budget, so are volatile. For funds to be appropriated from the Harbor Maintenance Trust Fund, Congress must vote on appropriations bills."
