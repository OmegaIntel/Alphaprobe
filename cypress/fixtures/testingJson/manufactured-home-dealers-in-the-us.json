Volatile lending conditions have left a notable imprint, with low interest rates following the outbreak of COVID-19 giving a boost to financing availability and boosting the industry. However, the subsequent rise in interest rates and tighter lending regulations increased financing hurdles for potential homebuyers, leading to a slowdown of revenue growth towards the end of the period.",

Following COVID-19, historically low interest rates bolstered the availability of financing, benefiting manufactured home dealers. However, in the later years of the period, higher interest rates and stricter lending policies have made financing more challenging for potential homebuyers. Consequently, these harsher lending conditions have affected affordability, deterring some buyers and contributing to declining revenue at the end of the period."

This increase in traditional home prices has led to a surge in demand for manufactured homes, benefiting dealers in the industry. As more prospective homeowners are priced out of the traditional market, manufactured homes offer a cost-effective alternative, fueling growth in the sector."
