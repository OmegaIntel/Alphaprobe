With increased corporate profits and consumer expenditure, industry revenue rose at an estimated annualized 0.1%, reaching $19.4 billion over the five years to 2024. This includes a disruption in 2020 with a halt in international travel and a slump in consumer spending attributable to the pandemic. Nonetheless, a strong pre-pandemic recovery and an anticipated surge in leisure travel demand project a promising outlook for the industry, with projected revenue increase of 3.4% in 2024.",
