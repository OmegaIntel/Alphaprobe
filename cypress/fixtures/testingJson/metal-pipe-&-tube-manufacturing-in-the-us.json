    "executive_summary": "Through the current period, metal pipe and tube manufacturing revenue has expanded alongside volatile commodity prices and elevated inflation. The pandemic also hindered metal pipe and tube manufacturers, creating contractions in construction and manufacturing markets. Despite these challenges, manufacturers reaped strong growth in 2022 as steel prices climbed. Slight declines in revenue in recent years reflect cooling demand and inflation. Metal pipe and tube manufacturing revenue is forecast to rise at a CAGR of 0.2% to $17.1 billion through the end of 2024, including a 0.2% decline during the current year. Industry profit is expected to remain fairly steady despite faltering revenue.",

OCTG pipes represent a family of pipes and tubes primarily used in oil drilling operations and pipeline construction. Oil and gas markets struggle to substitute metal pipes and tubes with plastic or concrete pipes; manufacturers specifically build metal pipes and tubes to withstand the highly corrosive and high-pressure environments that characterize oil and gas extraction projects."

Similarly, key oil and natural gas markets and suppliers rely on favorable crude oil prices. Supply chain disruptions have created significant instability for manufacturing during and following the pandemic. Steel prices skyrocketed in 2021 and 2022 as suppliers struggled to meet resurgent demand. Similarly, the Russian invasion of Ukraine led to major sanctions on Russian oil and steel, exacerbating supply chain concerns."

Household and nonresidential projects also use metal pipes, but plastic pipes often fill the same niche at lower costs, encouraging manufacturers to focus on utility markets. Construction markets struggled following the pandemic as the Federal Reserve raised interest rates to combat rampant inflation. As interest rates skyrocketed, companies grew wary of major spending projects, preferring to postpone new construction."

The trade-weighted index's notable jump in 2022 has made imports more affordable in domestic markets. The United States has attempted to mitigate imports through trade restrictions, including antidumping and countervailing duties, imposed on certain metal pipes imported from countries like South Korea and Turkey. These measures have faced limited success, especially as the economy recovers from the pandemic and foreign producers rush to fill demand shortages."
