    "executive_summary": "The car rental services industry fluctuated during the period. Stay-at-home orders during the pandemic prevented traveling, decimating the market. As vaccinations spread, restrictions lifted, leading to an influx of leisure and business travel. While operators recovered, inflationary concerns constrained additional growth. Revenue grew at a 1.8% CAGR to $57.65 billion over the past five years, including 4.5% in 2023. Average profit increased from 2020 lows. New car prices made renting cost-effective. Car sharing became popular. Public transportation, ride-sharing, and taxis remain substitutes but car rental is less expensive and more efficient. Strategic partnerships will help expand customer base and personalize services. Adopting technology to streamline rental process is critical. Revenue will grow at a 1.6% CAGR to $83.1 billion by 2028.",
