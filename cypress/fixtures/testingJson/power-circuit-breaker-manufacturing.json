    "executive_summary": "The Power Circuit Breaker Manufacturing industry has experienced fluctuations over the five years to 2021 due to volatile input costs, high import penetration and inconsistent downstream demand. Government-mandated business closures amid the COVID-19 (coronavirus) pandemic significantly impaired activity within some of the industry's key markets, such as industrial production and nonresidential construction, resulting in a significantly decline in demand. Moreover, there has been continued pressure from competitively priced imports into the domestic market, ultimately constraining industry performance. Intense import competition, coupled with unfavorable economic conditions due to the coronavirus pandemic has caused an unstable environment for industry operators. As a result of these trends, industry revenue is anticipated to decline at an annualized rate of 4.5% to $2.6 billion over the five years to 2021.",
