Companies such as Iron Mountain Inc. and Xerox Corporation have played significant roles, offering comprehensive service packages that cater to a diverse clientele. COVID-19 initially slowed economic activity across the board, but the industry saw a surprising uptick in 2020 as higher disposable incomes led people and businesses to invest more heavily in digitization solutions. The subsequent economic recovery further fueled this trend, with businesses possessing more liquidity and opting for digitization to streamline operations in 2021 and 2022. Because of these factors, profit has expanded during the current period.",
