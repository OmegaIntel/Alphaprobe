However, staffing shortages across the country have necessitated technological interventions. Mental health practitioners adapted swiftly and offered teletherapy via apps and other online platforms, making mental health services more accessible. Because of increased government support during the pandemic, the industry witnessed a spike in revenue in 2020 and 2021, with projections showing a CAGR of 6.5% to $31.3 billion through 2024, despite an expected one-year momentary dip in revenue of 0.2%.",
