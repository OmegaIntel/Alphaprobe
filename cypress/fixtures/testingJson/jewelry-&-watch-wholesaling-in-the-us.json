    "executive_summary": "Wholesalers have encountered volatility because of unstable prices of precious metals. Precious metals are a critical input to products, and the weight of the precious metal that a piece of jewelry contains primarily determines its retail price. Any significant change in the prices of commodities, including gold, silver or platinum, strongly influences the industry because it affects both the cost and selling price of goods. Because of volatility in input costs, industry revenue has dropped at a CAGR of 3.1% to $54.5 billion over the past five years, including a 2.7% decline in 2023. Profit has also fallen to 3.1% of revenue in 2023 from 4.0% in 2018.",
