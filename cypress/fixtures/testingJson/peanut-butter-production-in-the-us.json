A typical peanut butter plant uses a conveyer-belt system that takes shelled peanuts through a process of roasting, cooling, blanching, splitting, grinding and mixing, before the end product is jarred and shipped. Technological advancements over the past few decades have helped producers automate many of the processes traditionally performed by labor, further increasing the industry's reliance on capital."
