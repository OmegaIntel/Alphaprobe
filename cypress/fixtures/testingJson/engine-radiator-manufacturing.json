    "executive_summary": "Figures have been adjusted for inflation and are presented in 2020 currency. The Engine Radiator Manufacturing industry consists of companies that design and assemble radiators for motor vehicles. Downstream markets mainly include third-party manufacturers that sell radiators to large in addition to retailers and mechanics. However, this industry does not include parts that are manufactured and installed into vehicles within a single location because there is no transaction to count toward revenue. Over the five years to 2020, the industry has struggled financially. Imports from low wage countries such as China and Mexico have continued to pose a threat for domestic companies, while fluctuations in material costs have contributed to revenue volatility. Companies in this industry primarily sell to large car manufacturers, so industry demand is closely linked with demand for new cars. For this reason, declining new car sales have hurt industry demand over the past five years.",

When disposable income levels are high, people are more willing to make large purchases. Additionally, when unemployment is low, people are more likely to purchase new cars because they can be more certain that they are able to make consistent payments. However, in 2020, the COVID-19 (coronavirus) pandemic is likely to hurt demand for new cars."

While the pandemic is expected to hurt profit due to low demand and shortages of materials, profit had declined over most of the past five years. Competition from large automakers has grown in recent years, and prior to the ratification of USMCA, foreign manufacturers had been threatening domestic operations."
