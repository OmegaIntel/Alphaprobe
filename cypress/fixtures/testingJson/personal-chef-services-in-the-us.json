    "executive_summary": "Figures have been adjusted for inflation and are presented in 2024 currency. Personal chef services continue to endure mixed growth results over the past five years, as a mixture of healthy eating trends has coincided with shaky economic conditions among downstream customers. Many consumers shifted toward healthier eating options amid COVID-19 to preserve their health and gain nutrients from daily meals. Since personal chef services are primarily geared toward customers with limited mobility or leisure time to prepare their meals, it created a robust demand niche that helped accelerate servicer demand. However, as the economy reopened and inflationary pressures heightened, consumers shifted their eating habits toward more traditional mediums such as restaurants and cafes. With consumers' fiscal flexibility dampened, it harmed operator demand, causing revenue to inch downward at a CAGR of 0.2% to an estimated $4.5 billion through the end of 2024, including an anticipated 0.7% boost in 2024.",

Personal chef services are highly dependent on stable economic conditions among consumers, which have been volatile due to higher inflationary pressures. The robust preparation process that personal chefs undertake require a significant quantity of raw produce, creating high production costs in accordance with the respective meals offered to customers."

            "current_performance_point_description": "As consumers continue to shift their eating habits toward healthier, more sustainable options, personal chefs have seen an uptick in demand for niche meals. Since personal chef services are a niche service that is primarily provided on an on-demand basis, it is more isolated to customers that can afford it but that are in real need of the service, such as elderly customers. The proliferation of gluten-free and plant-based meals has created a variety of healthy food niches that benefit personal chef service demand. With consumers shifting toward healthier eating options following COVID-19, it created a new revenue stream for operators, particularly among middle-aged customers looking to stay in shape."
