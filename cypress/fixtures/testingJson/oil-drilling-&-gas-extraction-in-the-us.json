The pandemic halted the economy and ripped away steady growth as restrictions limited the need for oil and gas. The conflict in Ukraine added to the uncertainty, as the reliance on Russian oil and gas was distributed between domestic producers and other sources. As the economy recovered, the need for oil and gas shot up quicker than supply could match, causing prices to surge and generating substantial returns. Revenue has swelled at a CAGR of 3.1%, reaching $497.8 billion in 2024, including a 2.3% uptick in 2024 alone.",

These measures kept people at home and slowed nearly all industries, drastically cutting the need for fossil fuels.
