            "question": "Has your company been exposed to volatile input prices?",
            "answer": "Fruits and vegetables are the main ingredients in industry products. These commodities' prices are difficult to forecast, as weather patterns affect them. Industry players are also concerned with the price of sugar, plastic materials and resin, aluminum, diesel fuel and natural gas, which also exhibit volatility. Companies that successfully use strategies to hedge the risk of movements in commodity prices, including commodities derivative instruments and initiatives like preventing additional regulation of beverage manufacturers, and it provides a forum for manufacturers to discuss and defend their marketing and bottling practices."

            "answer": "Companies that produce a wide range of brands can target many different markets simultaneously, offsetting losses from one product with gains from another.

            "question": "Do you cater your products to changing consumer preferences? How do you stay ahead of trends?",
            "answer": "As consumers become more health-conscious and preferences shift away from carbonated soda and toward more natural flavored juices, companies must be prepared to supply a variety of drinks to end markets.

            "question": "How does declining per capita fruit and vegetable consumption affect your company's sales?",
            "answer": "Per capita fruit and vegetable consumption is generally on the long-term downtrend since these products are typically more expensive and consumers have increasingly satisfied daily nutritional requirements via other food groups. Consumers who eat more fruits and vegetables are more likely to buy industry products and satisfy daily fruit and vegetable intake through juice. A declining preference for fruits and vegetables may indicate falling interest in specific juices that are produced by industry players."

        {
            "question": "Do you monitor the healthy eating index for use in product development? How do you expect demand for your product to fare as consumers become more health-conscious?",
            "answer": "Increasing health awareness may benefit industry products that are all-natural or low in sugar. Accordingly, consumers have increasingly shied away from juices high in calories or containing a significant concentration of sugar or other additives."
