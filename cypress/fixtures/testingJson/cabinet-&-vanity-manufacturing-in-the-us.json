The industry faced volatility due to the turbulent housing market over the past five years. COVID-19 initially impacted the industry negatively, but low interest rates and fiscal stimulus boosted demand as the housing market boomed in 2020 and 2021. However, climbing import penetration subdued growth for domestic manufacturers. As interest rates rose and disposable income growth fell due to inflation, the industry suffered towards the end of 2023. Industry revenue has been falling at a CAGR of 2.4% over the past five years and is expected to total $16.5 billion in 2023, with an estimated 5.6% drop.",
