The relative strength of the US economy has propelled private banks, as wealthy individuals worldwide have sought to park their wealth in secure assets like urban real estate. Even amid the pandemic in 2020, market accumulation spurred growth. Overall, the need for private banking services has increased as the global number of high-net-worth and ultra-high-net-worth individuals has grown. Industry-wide revenue has been growing at a CAGR of 5.0% to $95.9 billion over the past five years, including an expected jump of 3.6% in 2024 alone.\n\n## Key Growth Driver\n\nA key theme driving growth is the rise of globalization. During the period, wealthy individuals expanded in regions outside the US, most notably the Asia-Pacific region. In turn, wealth managers have increasingly engaged in cross-border wealth management practices to push up assets under management. The Russia-Ukraine conflict, compounded by rising interest rates, induced volatility in capital markets and increased investor uncertainty, driving clients to private banks.",
