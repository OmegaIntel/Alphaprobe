    "executive_summary": "Long-term trends like globalization, immigration and internet connectivity have continued to usher in revenue growth for language learning software developers. As the US population becomes more diverse, use of language learning apps expands, especially with Spanish-focused courses. Consumers have continued to prefer on-demand, convenient options for self-improvement and learning, which has fueled revenue growth. Industry-wide revenue has climbed at a CAGR of 2.1% to $4.0 billion over the five years to 2023, when revenue will jump by an estimated 4.2%. The COVID-19 pandemic posed some threat to the industry as travel ceased and consumers had no need to learn a language in preparation for vacations overseas. Still, the industry's status as a socially distanced option for self-improvement and mental stimulus helped sustain software producers. Intense competition has forced companies to lower prices and suffer reduced profit. In response, the industry's largest platforms have rolled out AI-powered premium options to help manage fixed costs.",

Similarly, higher corporate profit encourages corporations to invest in language learning programs for employees.
