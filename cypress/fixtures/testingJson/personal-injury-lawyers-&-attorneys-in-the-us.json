A consistent flow of legal cases and a rapid recovery following the pandemic has helped personal injury lawyers and attorneys endure growth over the past five years, albeit with slight volatility. Many firms rely on cases related to automobile accidents, which plummeted in 2020, as fewer individuals were on the road. Personal injury lawyers focused in other specialties or running more generalized practices fared better. Overall, revenue is expected to rise at a CAGR of 2.0% to an estimated $57.3 billion, including an estimated increase of 0.4% in 2024 alone.",

In 2020, the number of vehicle accidents plummeted 22.3%, as the proliferation of remote work kept many people off the roads. As economic conditions improved and consumer activity resumed following the pandemic, the frequency of fatal crashes increased, with fatal crashes growing 9.9% in 2021, according to the latest data from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA)."

Many elder care facilities experienced worker shortages amid the pandemic, resulting in poor conditions for patients and an increase in medical malpractice cases. Since older patients are most susceptible to a variety of diseases and medical conditions, it generates greater demand among the elderly population, particularly since this age demographic has the strongest disposable incomes."

Plaintiffs often target joint liability scenarios when any single liable party is unlikely to meet the financial damages alone. Since joint liability cases can lead to substantial payouts, they mostly result in structured settlements that spread payments over a specified period rather than as a lump sum, generating longer-term revenue for lawyers successfully litigating such cases."
