    "executive_summary": "Figures have been adjusted for inflation and are presented in 2024 currency.\n\nThe industry has faced volatility, driven partly by fluctuations in military spending as a percentage of GDP. Historically, declines in federal contracts, particularly following the drawdown of US military involvement in Iraq and Afghanistan, have strained industry revenue. The aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis also spurred government efforts to reduce overall spending, impacting defense budgets and strategic priorities. This shift has redirected focus towards addressing non-traditional security threats like cyber warfare, necessitating different defense capabilities and investments. While these changes have negatively affected the industry, stable demand from local law enforcement agencies has provided some stability through regular replacement cycles.\n\nThe conflict in Ukraine in early 2022 led to a notable uptick in industry revenue due to heightened demand for body armor exports. This surge was driven by increased international shipments to support Ukrainian forces. The expected increase in the Department of Defense budget for 2024 is poised to elevate demand for body armor, primarily from the Army, even as demand from the Marine Corps is anticipated to decline. As a result, industry revenue is expected to rise 7.4% in 2024. Despite the positive outlook for 2024, industry revenue is projected to decline at a CAGR of 2.6% through 2024, reaching $770.8 million. This decline is mainly attributed to a significant drop in demand experienced in 2020.",
