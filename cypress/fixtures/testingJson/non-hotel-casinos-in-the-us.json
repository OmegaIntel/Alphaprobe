    "executive_summary": "Non-hotel casinos have struggled over the past five years, mainly because of an influx of new casino hotels in states that have eased restrictions on casinos. Increased competition has placed pressure on profit, and the outbreak of COVID-19 forced many casinos to close temporarily, resulting in revenue plummeting an estimated 22.1% in 2020 alone. Tourism trends significantly affect casino revenue because consumers tend to spend their income on gambling while on vacation or a weekend getaway. Rising domestic travel benefited the industry until 2020 when the effects of COVID-19 paused travel for many consumers. In 2021, as regulations eased and more of the general public became vaccinated, consumers flocked to industry establishments, resulting in a sharp uptick in revenue. Revenue has not yet returned to pre-pandemic levels.",

As unemployment rose and consumer confidence fell in 2020, demand for services weakened since consumers didn't have the funds for discretionary spending like gambling. Casinos have had to contend with changing consumer preferences as young people flock to other forms of entertainment, like live music and online games. Online casinos and sportsbooks have captured a significant portion of this demographic."

These establishments offer gambling opportunities, attracting both local residents and tourists, thereby boosting economic activity and providing a source of income through taxes and licensing fees. The non-hotel casino industry in the US has grown at a CAGR of 1.5% to $22.7 billion over the past five years, including a 1.0% increase in 2024. Inflation and volatility have hindered revenue growth slightly towards the end of the period. The industry will benefit from an improving economy and a growing social acceptance of gambling. Gambling has become an established part of US culture, and most Americans now view casino gambling as acceptable. Still, the industry will continue to face increasing pressure from new casino hotels as states look to casino operations to boost tax revenue. Consumers' demand for more interactive forms of entertainment, like live shows and concerts, will also threaten the industry. Industry revenue will increase at a CAGR of 1.3% to $24.2 billion over the next five years."

New sports betting may benefit the industry, but it may also cause increased cannibalization if states rapidly open up new casinos. The rise in popularity of online sportsbooks will also threaten casinos with greater competition. Since sports betting has traditionally been prevalent online, its legalization may drive many individuals to bet at home, decreasing foot traffic in casinos."
