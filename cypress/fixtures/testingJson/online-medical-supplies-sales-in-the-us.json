Early shortages of personal protective equipment and respirators during the initial COVID-19 outbreak were an outcome of under-supply colliding with unprecedented demand.

Healthcare organizations needed supplies to treat sick patients, while households sought masks and gloves en masse to stay healthy. An influx of COVID-19 patients at hospitals created unprecedented supply shortages. While an explosion in demand for healthcare supplies heightened the role of medical suppliers in the supply chain, global shortages impeded companies' capacity.
