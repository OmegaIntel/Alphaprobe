This is how funds usually attract new clients. Superior returns and transparency have helped funds in the industry maintain and attract clients."
        },
        {
            "question": "How diversified are your product offerings compared to competitors?",
            "answer": "Different alternative asset managers specialize in different kind of investment strategies. For example, some hedge funds specialize in merger arbitrage investing while some private equity funds specialize in leveraged buyout investing. However, the time it takes to master these investment skills is extensive, which often times leads managers to not specialize in multiple investment strategies."

        {
            "question": "Does your company have exposure to fintech competitors? How is it affecting your strategy moving forward?",
            "answer": "Alternative asset managers, especially hedge funds, have exposure to rapidly evolving fintech. As hedge funds become increasingly important in security market making, having high-frequency trading capabilities is increasingly important. While managers have not faced mounting pressure from fintech competitors as digitization trends accelerate, the threat still remains present."

            "question": "What international operations do you conduct and how could you benefit from increasing your international reach?",
            "answer": "The globalization of financial services has benefitted alternative asset managers in the form of rising assets under management. As assets under management increases, asset managers earn higher investment management fees. Additionally, operators invest in securities and businesses globally as well."

        {
            "question": "To what extent are your processes automated and how do you plan on investing in automation over the coming years?",

        {
            "question": "How do you ensure that you stay up to date with software and technology trends?",

        {
            "question": "How do you expect the proposed changes to Dodd-Frank to affect your business?",
            "answer": "Alternative asset managers have benefited from Dodd-Frank due to their increased importance as market makers after the law. Investment banks are only allowed to own 3.0% of funds under the law, which has hurt them. Basel III capital requirements and stress testing do not affect alternative asset managers as they are not banking institutions required to comply. Alternative asset managers generally have the capital needed to invest in new technology/software as it becomes available."

            "question": "What measures does your company have in place to keep things secure? Have you ever experienced a breach in security?",

            "question": "How does your company stay compliant to regulations?",

            "question": "Do you track access to credit? As access to credit increases, how will this benefit demand for your company?",

            "question": "How much of your revenue depends on demand from retirement and pension plans? How will you capitalize on this opportunity?",
