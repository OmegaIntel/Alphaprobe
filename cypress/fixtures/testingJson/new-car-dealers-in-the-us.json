    "executive_summary": "New car dealers are highly susceptible to changes in the economic environment. Weak consumer confidence, disposable income and corporate profit during the pandemic led to sharp declines in 2020; lockdown restrictions also limited driving and travel activity, contributing to weak demand for new cars and repair services. However, rising incomes and rebounding confidence have supported the industry's recovery. Demand for new vehicles has tempered since, as rising interest rates have increased the cost of buying on credit while the broader economy has begun to normalize. Nonetheless, revenue has climbed at an expected CAGR of 1.5% to an estimated $1.2 trillion through the current period, including a 0.4% jump in 2024, where profit will reach 1.8%.",

            "current_performance_point_description": "Supply chain issues at the manufacturing and distribution levels stemming from the COVID-19 pandemic led to severe shortages of parts, computer chips, and vehicles during the pandemic's peak. Soaring input prices made new cars significantly more expensive, increasing inventory costs. Similarly, semiconductor and electronic component shortages reduced supply, leaving dealers with limited inventories. Even so, dealers were largely able to leverage torrid demand and pass added costs onto buyers, creating strong revenue growth. Companies have also integrated online services to make the car-buying process simpler and more accessible."
