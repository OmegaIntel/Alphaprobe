This industry is dominated by small companies operating only a few locations and serving specific geographic regions. Over the five years to 2022, the industry has contracted due to heightened competition from online retailers, toy and hobby stores and big-box retailers. External operators offer a wider variety of services and competitively priced products as well as added convenience. Consequently, industry revenue has declined an annualized 4.3% to $2.0 billion over the five years to 2022, including a decrease of 3.2% in 2022 alone.",
