    "executive_summary": "Demand for forensic technology service providers depends on investment from state, county, municipal and the federal government. Since government agencies are essentially the primary market for services, many forensic crime labs rely heavily on tax revenue and robust crime budgets for agencies to outsource work to them. Public spending surged during the pandemic as the federal government sought to prevent the US economy from falling into a massive recession, raising revenue in 2020 and 2021. As these expenditures lapsed as COVID-19 ended, funds for forensic technology labs slowed, causing revenue to lag in 2022 and 2023.",

Agencies received lots of funding during COVID-19 as the federal government engaged in massive deficit spending to prevent a major economic collapse. Since many public organizations were flush with cash, they boosted their investment in forensic technology services, causing revenue to shoot up in 2020 and 2021. As the pandemic ended, COVID-19 era aid expired, while state and local governments concerned about high deficits slashed their spending. Since government investment fell, investment in forensic technology services dropped, causing revenue to depress in 2022 and 2023."

Much of the recent growth for forensic technology service companies has stemmed from the introduction of high-tech biometrics technology. Advances in DNA analysis have enabled forensic science technicians to extract larger quantities of valuable data from smaller DNA samples."

Higher government spending can increase the amount of outsourced work these governments can afford and increase their in-house forensic capabilities, spurring demand for the industry's services. Despite these developments, the crime rate will continue to drop because of the aging of the US population and higher education rates, fostering a decline in revenue in the years leading up to 2029."
