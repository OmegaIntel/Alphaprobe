The proliferation of broadband internet connections and the erosion of stigmas against online dating have helped the industry thrive. Furthermore, companies that are able to take advantage of rising smartphone adoption in the United States have been highly successful, with many companies offering services exclusively through mobile apps. Consumers are increasingly accessing the internet through their smartphones, enabling consumers to access online dating services at their convenience. As a result, overall industry revenue will grow at a CAGR of 6.1% to $3.6 billion over the past five years, with a 1.0% increase in 2024 alone.",

Mobile dating apps have increased dating efficiency due to offering users a more on-the-go approach, compared with online websites where computers are the primary communication mode. Overall, online and mobile dating services make up a significant portion of the industry's revenue, with a combined total of more than 60.0%."

Hinge and similar apps reflect the latest trends in the industry, including the concept of 'slow dating', which aims to address the issue of 'dating app fatigue' that many users have reported experiencing.

An increase in leisure time and social isolation led to a spike in online dating services usage despite uncertain economic, political and public health conditions. With heightened demand, companies added video call features and allowed users to include coronavirus-related dating preferences in their profiles. These new preferences have stuck in the market, with users reporting that virtual dates enhance the dating process by eliminating awkward first encounters."

In March 2021, Match Group announced that users would soon be able to perform background checks on potential dates. The addition of such features could potentially raise subscription fees among participating apps as companies pass the cost onto the customers.
