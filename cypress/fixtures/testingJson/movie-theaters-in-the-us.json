    "executive_summary": "Demand for movie theaters has been on a consistent dip thanks to intense competition from online streaming platforms. The industry experienced its most significant drop in performance amid the outbreak of COVID-19, which fueled at-home viewership. The pandemic created substantial disruptions for the industry as theatres temporarily closed and audiences stayed home, which resulted in industry revenue plummeting 73.2% in 2020. Although the industry experienced robust growth in 2021 and 2022 as restrictions eased and audiences returned, revenue has yet to return to its pre-pandemic total. Revenue has fallen at a CAGR of 6.1% to $15.3 billion through the end of 2024. Profitability has returned following pandemic lows thanks to theatres implementing monthly subscription programs and offering premium concessions, but overall profit remains depressed from where it was in 2019.",

Even when movie theaters were eventually allowed to reopen, limited-capacity seating prevented revenue growth that year. Pent-up demand brought moviegoers back to the theater in 2021, contributing to a massive period of growth that extended into 2022. Growth has since returned to typical marginal rates in 2024, when revenue will hike 1.3%."

Widespread inflation in 2022 pushed grocery store and energy bills upwards dramatically, leading to a drop in disposable income. Dropping per capita, disposable income puts pressure on movie theaters to keep their prices low, but many movie theaters can't drop their prices because of their already cumbersome revenue-generation challenges."
