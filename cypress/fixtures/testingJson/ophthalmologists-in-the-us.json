Ophthalmologists play a crucial role in meeting the medical needs of an aging population at greater risk of age-related eye diseases like cataracts, glaucoma and macular degeneration. Ophthalmology providers also benefit from a steady patient base, as a significant share of the US population experiences conditions requiring eye care beyond what optometrists can provide. While the pandemic disrupted years of stable growth, postponed eye care led to long backlogs of appointments, allowing practices to recoup losses in 2021. Normalizing patient volumes and slowing health spending will steady growth in 2024, with recent inflation not significantly impacting consumers' decision to seek care. Since no substitutes exist for surgical eye care, revenue has been expanding despite recent volatility, increasing at a CAGR of 0.6% to an estimated $16.7 billion over the past five years, including an expected jump of 1.3% in 2024.",

As adults age, the incidence of eye diseases that risk vision loss increases, requiring an ophthalmologist's intervention to protect and restore vision. Consolidation activity will ramp up, shifting the industry's makeup from small, private practices to larger groups. Eye care groups, often backed by private equity, offer patients access to multiple specialties and innovative diagnostic equipment but make remaining independent more challenging. In all, revenue will expand at a CAGR of 2.5% to an estimated $18.9 billion over the next five years."
