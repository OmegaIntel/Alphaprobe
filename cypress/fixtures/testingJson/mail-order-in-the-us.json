    "executive_summary": "Mail-order retailers are companies that primarily use mail catalogs and TV to display and sell merchandise. Rapidly increasing competition from online shopping outlets forced mail-order retailers to develop new strategies to prevent revenue losses or slow growth. E-commerce retailers offer levels of convenience that are highly attractive to consumers, lowering sales from mail order services, particularly among younger consumers. However, the industry benefited from the pandemic, as older consumers were encouraged to reduce exposure to the virus and stay at home. Revenue for mail-order businesses is expected to climb at a CAGR of 4.3% to $252.3 billion through the end of 2024, despite a forecast decline of 2.1% in 2024.",

The 2020 pandemic resulted in higher disposable income levels because of reduced expenses from other areas, like gas and entertainment. Stimulus programs also pushed up disposable income levels. Increasing disposable income boosted demand for mail-order products as social distancing regulations prevented consumers from going to traditional stores. Revenue grew by more than 8.0% each year between 2020 and 2022."

Also, rising competition from online retailers has siphoned away revenue and pressured profit. Over the past two decades, e-commerce has exhibited tremendous growth, lowering the need for traditional and mail order retailers. Online shopping revolutionized how consumers shop, as people now have more access to product information, including learning about other buyers' experiences with specific products and comparing prices across retailers."
