Still, economic expansion contributed to revenue growth during most of the period, as increased air travel and marine and railroad transportation encouraged sales of relevant equipment and supplies. The pandemic caused substantial disruption for the industry, with revenue declining 4.6% in 2020 alone. Subsequently, because of a recovering economy and reduction of travel restrictions, transportation demand rose \u2013 helping the industry resume expansion. Resilient economic growth has helped support equipment sales in recent years.",
