    "executive_summary": "Ethnic supermarkets are retailers that sell culturally diverse food for at-home consumption. The growing Hispanic and Asian populations in the United States heavily influence demand for ethnic ingredients and other products. Younger consumers across ethnic groups represent an increasing customer base for ethnic food retailers. The pandemic led to more consumers buying ethnic products, as many benefited from higher disposable income. Social distancing regulations forced many restaurants to operate at a lower capacity or fully shut down, pushing customers to cook more at home. This led many consumers outside the target demographic to explore different cultural ingredients, boosting sales and profit.",

Other ethnicities are becoming increasingly popular, particularly among major metropolitan cities. African cultures, including Ethiopian and West African, have established a market presence.

As the government lifted pandemic-related restrictions, indoor and outdoor dining regained popularity. This caused more customers to eat out and spend less on ingredients, resulting in falling revenue. Growing food price volatility and falling consumer confidence pushed many consumers to buy food from more affordable grocery stores, causing revenue to fall."

Well-established, traditional grocers can reach better deals with suppliers, offering lower prices and attracting more customers. The Asian population in the United States is also growing quickly, encouraging supermarkets to continue expanding their product range and boosting competition. Some traditional supermarkets have resorted to acquiring ethnic stores to better serve increasingly diverse communities, causing significant drops in the number of ethnic grocers."
