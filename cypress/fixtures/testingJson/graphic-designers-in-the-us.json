However, inflation, volatility and COVID-19 impacts have slowed revenue growth. Over the past 5 years, industry revenue grew at an estimated 2.8% CAGR to $16.6 billion in 2023. Economic growth encouraged new businesses to invest in graphic design for branding and advertising. Incumbent businesses also increased ad budgets to compete. COVID-19 impacted demand in 2020 but accelerated digital advertising adoption. Profit grew with rising demand and technological productivity gains. Over the next 5 years, revenue is projected to grow at a 2.0% CAGR to $18.3 billion, driven by increased ad spending and economic recovery.",
