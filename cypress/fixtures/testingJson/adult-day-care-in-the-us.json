    "executive_summary": "Over the last five years, the aging Baby Boomer generation, nearly one-fifth of the US population, has significantly boosted demand for adult day cares. Adult day cares have seen solid usage as improving life expectancies expands their primary client base. The industry's growing popularity as a low-cost alternative to nursing homes led to an influx of new providers, particularly among owner-operators offering at-home care. The rise of at-home adult day care services has perpetuated the industry's fragmentation, allowing new providers to cater to underserved areas. Despite this growth, labor shortages force higher wages and compress profit. Industry revenue has been climbing at a CAGR of 2.1% to an estimated $7.5 billion over the five years through 2024, including an expected rise of 1.3% in 2024 alone.",

Medicaid has expanded under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA), enabling more individuals to obtain funding for adult care services. Increased Medicaid funding has granted consumers an increased ability to afford adult care services based on insurance coverage, supporting industry revenue growth."

The number of adult day care services has accordingly climbed every year, especially in 2021 as unemployment and job insecurity led to a 10.8% jump in owner-operator adult day care services.
