Industry performance is closely tied to construction market trends, such as the level of private construction, as new property developments often involve demolition equipment to level existing buildings, as well as to clean up sites to prepare for new construction. Moreover, the industry is highly globalized and domestic manufacturers rely on exports for a significant share of revenue, in addition to steel inputs often imported from abroad. Over the five years to 2021, strong activity in downstream residential and nonresidential construction over the majority of the period has driven industry revenue growth. Resultingly, industry revenue has increased an annualized 3.0% to $12.1 billion over the five years to 2021.",
