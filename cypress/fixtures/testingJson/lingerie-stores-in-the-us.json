    "executive_summary": "The Lingerie Stores industry comprises retailers that predominantly sell lingerie, with large-format stores also selling related clothing such as shapewear, nightwear and swimwear. Demand for products has increased for most of the last few years as the economy has grown, providing consumers with more disposable income to spend on high-end lingerie. Many industry operators have tried to tap into new markets in recent years, expanding the consumer pool. But growth was mitigated thanks to a drop in disposable income growth, and revenue declined in 2021 and 2022. Over the years to 2023, revenue is estimated to have increased at a CAGR of 2.6% to $13.0 billion over the five years to 2023, including a growth of 2.4% in the current year.",

Lingerie stores benefit from improved customer service and product knowledge relative to big-box retailers, like Walmart and Target, that don't typically offer these value-added services. Many online operators, like Third Love, provide more inclusive sizing and a quick online survey to provide individuals with the most accurate size estimate as possible. Because sizing is so variable, online operators typically offer free returns and exchanges in order to make the process as easy as possible for the customer."

Over the past two decades, the average woman's bra size has increased from 34B to 34DD, partly driven by the increasing number of adults who are overweight or obese. The percentage of Americans that are overweight or obese has been steadily rising over the past three decades. Sales of larger bra sizes, such as DD, DDD and G cups, have been gaining popularity over the past five years. Plus-sized clothing has historically received less attention from designers compared to straight sizes, but lingerie stores are increasingly offering beautiful pieces for people of many sizes."

The product portfolios for these brands include lingerie made in bright colors and patterns, as well as smaller sizes, as well as other industry products like socks, tights and sleepwear. Bralettes, in particular, which are lightweight bras without molded cups or underwire, have attracted consumer attention and brought in revenue. Though these products were originally marketed toward young demographics, they have since become more mainstream due to their reputation of providing both comfort and style."

Many small niche companies will likely enter the industry, evidenced by enterprise gains. Niches include high-end products sleep and loungewear, bridal and maternal lingerie, as well as plus-sized products that aim to promote body positivity and diversity.

Retailers are expected to increasingly focus on this demographic to establish long-term brand loyalty. According to the Trust for America's Health, more than half of Americans will potentially be obese by 2030, creating greater demand from the plus-size market. By featuring models of different body types, races, ages and gender identities, lingerie brands can send a powerful message that everyone is deserving of feeling confident and beautiful in their own skin. This approach can really resonate with a broader customer base, leading to increased brand loyalty."

General apparel retailers have risen in popularity by offering inexpensive, fast-fashion lingerie items as part of their merchandise line, and as a result, many players have been forced to discount their prices and absorb losses to entice more customers into their stores. With competition forecast to increase, these price reductions are expected to become permanent for low- to mid-value lingerie products. This trend will cause overall industry profit to taper off slightly over the five years to 2028."
