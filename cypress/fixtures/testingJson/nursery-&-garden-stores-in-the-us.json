    "executive_summary": "Nursery and garden stores have experienced significant highs and lows over the past five years. Rising per capita disposable income and increased private spending on home improvements helped industry revenue stay strong during the pandemic. Meanwhile, individuals aged 35 and younger have expressed increased interest and demand for small plants, like succulents, to enhance the aesthetic of their living spaces. However, as inflation has increased and the number of housing starts has declined, operating costs have grown and commercial demand for plants has declined. As a result, nursery and garden store revenue is expected to decline at a CAGR of 0.1% through the end of 2024. Meanwhile, as operating costs remain high, profit is expected to drop to 4.3%.\n\nExternal competition has threatened the industry over the past five years. Big-box retailers, like Home Depot and e-commerce companies like Amazon, have taken a large share of product demand. These stores offer low prices and convenient access to thousands of products. Still, nursery and garden stores have often been able to compensate for higher prices by offering more in-depth product knowledge and superior customer service. With competition on the rise, garden store revenue is expected to fall 1.4% to $43.2 billion in 2024.",

With the high level of outside competition, garden stores must keep prices as low as possible. Garden stores often can't keep prices as low as big box retailers can. Retailers emphasize personalized services to compensate for their typically higher prices."

This trend is driven by urbanization and a desire for green space in smaller indoor living environments. As urbanization continues, people living in apartments will look to plants to make their spaces more comfortable and improve the air quality in their homes. In response, nursery and garden stores will expand their range of indoor plants, pots and related supplies and focus more marketing efforts on this segment."
