    "executive_summary": "The BBQ Charcoal Manufacturing industry produces charcoal-based fire-starting products that consumers use when cooking with a charcoal grill or smoker. BBQ charcoal demand has grown through 2023 as full employment and strong economic sentiment fueled consumer purchases of discretionary items like grilling equipment and fuels. More recently, however, economic shutdowns and widespread supply chain disruptions during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic limited the industry's growth. While these socioeconomic restrictions directly contributed to the industry's drop in 2020, it rebounded more than 17.0% in 2021 alone as outdoor activities, like BBQ events, remain extremely popular. Even so, as the economy contracts, the industry will falter an expected 3.2% in 2023. Overall, industry revenue has been rising at a CAGR of 0.5% over the past five years, and is expected to reach $1.6 billion in 2023.",
