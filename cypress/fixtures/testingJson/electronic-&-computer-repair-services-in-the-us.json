Industry performance generally runs countercyclical to poor economic conditions, as consumers substitute purchases with repairs during periods of economic uncertainty. Revenue declined over 2019-2024 due to low unemployment and high income supporting new device purchases versus repairs. Despite the pandemic, business closures and stay-at-home orders deepened demand declines in 2020 as consumers deferred repairs.",
