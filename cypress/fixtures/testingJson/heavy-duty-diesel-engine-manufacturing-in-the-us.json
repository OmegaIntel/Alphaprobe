    "executive_summary": "Figures have been adjusted for inflation and are presented in 2023 currency.\n\nHeavy-duty diesel engine manufacturers primarily make products used in freight trucks and industrial machinery. When COVID-19 hit, businesses were shut down, so consumer spending plunged. Businesses shipped fewer goods in response to lower consumer spending, so demand for trucks and diesel engines fell, causing revenue to plunge in 2020. As the economy recovered from the pandemic, businesses displayed record sales, resulting in high corporate profit. More profit enabled companies to invest more in manufacturing equipment, so demand for heavy-duty diesel engines rose, benefiting the industry. Rising interest rates have reduced home buying, so demand for construction has fallen. Weak construction demand has reduced the need for trucks carrying building materials, so revenue has been hampered in recent years. Lower steel prices have also hurt manufacturers, as they can't pass high costs onto consumers. Overall, revenue for heavy-duty diesel engine manufacturers is anticipated to decline at a CAGR of 3.2% during the current period, reaching $31.1 billion in 2023. Revenue is forecast to creep upward 0.9% in that year.\n\nThe industry will perform better in the near future, but revenue growth will still be meager. Manufacturers will benefit from steadily rising incomes, as they'll increase business activity, raising the need for trucks and heavy-duty diesel engines. The value of the US dollar will also decline, benefiting exports. Higher exports will create more revenue streams for the industry, boosting revenue. Engine producers will be hurt by falling industrial production, as this will reduce downstream demand from manufacturers. Higher Corporate Average Fuel Average (CAFE) standards will also rise, encouraging manufacturers to improve their engines so they can be more environmentally sustainable. Overall, revenue is forecast to creep upward at a CAGR of 0.7% during the current period, reaching $32.2 billion in 2028. Profit is projected to make up 5.7% of revenue in that year.",

These regulations caused consumer spending to plunge since everything was closed or severely restricted. Businesses didn't need to ship goods nearly as much because of lower economic activity, so demand for trucking tanked. Fewer trucks were purchased, so the need for heavy-duty diesel engines fell, causing revenue to drop significantly in 2020."
