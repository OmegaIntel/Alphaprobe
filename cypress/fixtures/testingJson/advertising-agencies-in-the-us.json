Advertising agencies have benefitted from rising consumer spending, corporate profit and per capita disposable income in recent years. Despite the outbreak of COVID-19 and falling advertising expenditure during the pandemic, revenue grew in 2020 as companies demanded creative services for COVID-19-focused marketing campaigns. As corporate profit returned following 2020, agencies were able to capitalize on an explosion of pent-up demand as businesses looked to target a consumer base with growing levels of disposable income. Industry-wide revenue has been growing at a CAGR of 2.7% over the past five years and is expected to total $70.1 billion in 2024, when revenue will jump by an estimated 1.9% and profit will inch toward 6.6%.",
