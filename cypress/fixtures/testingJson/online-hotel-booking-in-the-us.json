    "executive_summary": "The Online Hotel Booking industry comprises establishments primarily providing hotel booking services via online platforms. These websites are third-party platforms for customers to research and make hotel reservations. Over the past five years, more individuals willing to make online reservations have benefited the industry. Nevertheless, the industry was hit by the unprecedented COVID-19 that led to a substantial decline in travel rates, causing industry revenue to fall sharply in 2020. As travel restrictions were lifted in 2021, revenue has recovered strongly due to the release of pent-up demand. Over the five years to 2024, industry revenue is expected to grow at an annualized rate of 2.8% to $51.8 billion, including a 6.5% growth in 2024 alone.",
