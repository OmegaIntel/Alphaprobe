    "executive_summary": "Operators in the industry serve dessert-craving customers a range of treats, including ice cream, doughnuts and cookies. Industry demand has been bolstered over the past five years from the jump in per capita disposable income and per capita dairy consumption. Despite rising inflation and increasing input costs, the industry has still encountered rising demand. However, in 2020, the industry experienced a decline in revenue because of the temporary lockdown measures due to the pandemic. But as lockdown measures were lifted, consumers returned to dessert stores, boosting industry revenue. Over the past five years, revenue has grown at a CAGR of 3.3% to $20.4 billion, including an expected 0.3% decline in 2024. Profit is expected to lag to 4.7% of revenue in 2024 from 4.8% in 2019.",
