    "executive_summary": "Revenue for business valuation firms has been volatile during the current period. The strong economy pre-pandemic boosted business confidence, so companies engaged in many mergers and acquisitions (M&As), aiding revenue growth. Halting economic activity during COVID-19 caused corporate profit to plunge in 2020. This gave companies far fewer funds to invest in business valuation services, resulting in falling revenue growth during the pandemic. As corporate profit and consumer spending soared during the pandemic recovery, revenue recovered. Spending from individuals proceeded to slow recently because of declining per capita disposable income. This slowed investment in the industry's services from households and individuals. Access to credit has increased recently, causing households and businesses to purchase more assets. They've increased their uptake in business valuation services to determine the value of these new assets.",

            "current_performance_point_description": "The economy was strong at the beginning of the current period, as the United States was in the final stages of an expansion following the 2008 financial crisis. Businesses were extremely confident, so they engaged in mergers and acquisitions (M&As) at a rapid pace, boosting demand for business valuation services. Interest rates were also relatively low, making it easier for companies to borrow, which raised M&A activity and the purchase of stocks, bonds and financial derivatives. Many corporations sought to find the value of the business valuation services so they can find the value of the assets or companies they're seeking to purchase."

            "current_performance_point_title": "The Industry Displayed Significant Volatility During COVID-19",
            "current_performance_point_description": "As state and local governments shut down businesses during the pandemic, corporate profit plunged as many companies couldn't function. Since corporations use their profit to purchase business valuation services, they reduced their investment in the industry's services during the pandemic, causing revenue to fall in 2020. Despite these challenges, the industry avoided a steep decline in revenue in 2020 because some business valuation services were highly sought after. Since the US economy was performing terribly during the pandemic, some corporations experienced bankruptcy and liquidation. Shareholders and investors in these companies sought business valuation services to value the assets of companies going under, which rescued revenue growth somewhat."

            "current_performance_point_description": "During COVID-19, incomes soared because of a surge in government subsidies, including stimulus checks and unemployment insurance. Public help cost the government trillions of dollars per year, so they pulled the plug on aid as the economy recovered. This caused per capita disposable income to plunge in 2022. Lower incomes reduced consumers' ability to afford homes, cars and other assets. Since households commonly pay business valuation firms to estimate the value of these assets, revenue declined as the purchase of homes and vehicles fell."

Strong economic growth will raise business sentiment and corporate profit, causing more companies to engage in mergers and acquisitions (M&As), stock purchases and cash flow analyses, which will boost demand for the industry's services. Per capita disposable income will also expand, increasing investment in valuation services from households as more consumers will seek to estimate the value of cars, boats, homes and other expensive assets they seek to purchase. Demand for company valuations will also rise as individuals will want to determine if a corporation is stable enough for them to put their excess cash in."

They want to receive the highest return on their investments, so they'll search for the bonds, stocks and other instruments that are the most valuable. To find the best companies to invest in for retirement, older households increase their uptake in valuation services, aiding revenue growth. The baby boomer generation is the wealthiest in the United States. As more boomers die or set up trust funds for their children, some younger people will become wealthier. With this newfound wealth, younger investors will start new businesses and purchase financial instruments, increasing spending on the industry's services and contributing to higher revenue growth during the outlook period."

New software (e.g., YCharts, Bloomberg Terminal, Grata, QuickBooks, Performance Pro, Culture Amp) will enable corporations to access information on asset prices and retrieve a company's financial information quickly and efficiently. The increased prevalence of substitutes will enable companies to perform the industry's services in-house or migrate to other customers (e.g., accounting firms), siphoning revenue from the industry. The adoption of better software in particular will pose a serious threat to business valuation firms, as many corporations and individuals simply want basic information on a company before buying stocks, bonds and other financial instruments. Since new software will increasingly enable customers to do just that, they'll stop using traditional valuation companies."

They will seek to use new technology to keep their services relevant. Companies will also employ new financial models (e.g., risk-adjusted discount rates) to provide more specific information on cash flow to companies.
