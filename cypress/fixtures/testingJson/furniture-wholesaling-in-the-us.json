    "executive_summary": "Furniture wholesalers have endured some volatility in recent years. The health of the residential and nonresidential construction sectors largely impacts new furniture sales. During the initial stages of the pandemic, wholesalers were negatively affected by rising office rental vacancies, higher unemployment and weaker corporate profit. All of these trends led to weaker demand for office furniture, the largest product segment in the industry. Although demand for home furniture grew amid near-zero interest rates and higher disposable income, these gains could not make up for losses in the commercial sector, pushing revenue down. These trends have led to revenue shrinking at an estimated CAGR of 1.3% to $61.1 billion through 2024, including a 0.8% gain that year alone.",

Since many consumers consider new furniture a discretionary purchase, lower disposable income encourages them to postpone or fully cancel buying new furniture, harming wholesalers."

These trends prevented the creation of new businesses, harming demand for office and commercial furniture. Businesses shifting to remote and hybrid working have harmed office furniture sales amid climbing office rental vacancies."

The sector has endured significant volatility in recent years, contributing to sales fluctuations and weaker growth. Housing starts and existing home sales jumped in 2020 and 2021 due to low interest rates and high disposable income, driving demand for home furniture. However, in 2022, interest rate hikes, inflation and consumer uncertainty negatively impacted home furniture sales."

Similarly, the value of nonresidential construction will continue to expand amid recovering economic conditions. During this time, rising corporate profit and stabilizing unemployment will make the office vacancy rate fall, supporting office furniture sales."
