Industry products are distributed to wholesalers, retailers and other intermediaries for resale to consumers. Over the five years to 2021, the industry has benefited from trends including improving disposable incomes and greater demand for premium chocolate goods. However, other trends, such as volatile cocoa prices and rising health consciousness, have limited industry revenue growth. Overall, IBISWorld expects industry revenue to decline an annualized 0.4% to $938.5 million over the five years to 2021, including a projected decline of 0.1% in 2020 due to the rapid deterioration of downstream demand stemming from the recent COVID-19 (coronavirus) pandemic. However, the industry is expected to bounce back with growth of 2.3% in 2021.",

As a result, IBISWorld industry revenue declined an estimated 0.1% in 2020, although it is expected to bounce back with growth of 2.3% in 2021."
