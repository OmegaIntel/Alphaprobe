    "executive_summary": "The Bare Printed Circuit Board Manufacturing industry manufactures circuit boards for various downstream uses, including consumer electronics, high-end electronics, such as medical, scientific and military equipment and automobiles. Demand for bare printed circuit boards has been declining consistently over the past two decades. This trend is mainly driven by prominent import penetration. Lower production costs overseas enable foreign producers to charge lower prices, boosting price competition and causing profit to shrink.",

The production of these boards is often less intense than other electronic components, pushing buyers to look for more affordable alternatives that meet quality standards. Producers based in countries with lower operating costs, such as China and Taiwan, can offer lower-priced products while remaining profitable, resulting in enhanced price competition and causing demand for domestically produced boards to weaken."

            "current_performance_point_description": "The growing reliance on electronic products has boosted demand and production of semiconductors, as a broader range of downstream manufacturers use them as an input. The CHIPS and Science Act of 2022 invests heavily in onshoring semiconductor production. Companies like Qualcomm and GlobalFoundries appear committed to building US production and research facilities. Although many industries use this technology, policies focus on strengthening domestic supply chains and lower the United States' reliance on China-based manufacturers."

            "current_performance_point_description": "The pandemic had an immediate effect on bare printed circuit board production, as many manufacturing facilities were forced to pause operations to slow the spread of the virus. Despite quickly reopening, production struggled to keep up with a massive upswing in demand and order backlogs. While exports were hindered due to trade slowing down, producers serving military and defense markets were largely unaffected due to already established contracts. This market has also contributed to the rising demand for domestic producers, further supporting the industry."

Although private investment is likely to continue, it will grow at a slower rate than in previous years, weakening revenue growth. Ongoing supply chain disruptions and the recovery of China's manufacturing sector will continue to harm domestic manufacturing activity. Producers serving sectors like defense and aerospace will benefit from steady demand and new opportunities, as these are emerging as major downstream markets and can provide above-average profit."

However, as the global economy continues to recover, the value of the dollar is expected to weaken, making domestically produced boards comparatively more affordable than imports. A stronger US dollar is unlikely to make up for the price advantage foreign producers have. However, this is expected to cause the value of imports to drop significantly faster than the value of exports, portraying higher demand for domestic circuit boards. Although imports will become comparatively more expensive, they will continue posing a significant threat to domestic producers, partially due to lifted tariffs on Chinese products."

The industry's future largely hinges on the uncertain recovery of the US manufacturing sector. Bare printed circuit board production is expected to continue contracting because of significant imbalances in supply and demand for domestic circuit boards. As more companies offshore operations to countries with lower operating costs, domestic production is expected to weaken."

Similarly, the CHIPS Act and the Defense Production Act are meant to promote the domestic production of these circuit boards. Strong preferences from the defense sector favoring US produced printed circuit boards help secure some steady demand over the years to come, ensuring a somewhat stable demand for bare printed circuit boards."

    "industry_definition": "This industry manufactures bare printed circuit boards (PCB), which are a major input for electronics manufacturing. Bare PCBs differ from other PCBs because they lack electronic components such as transistors or capacitors. Electronics manufacturers add electronic components to bare PCBs to meet their specific product needs. Producers make bare PCBs from alternating conducting layers (e.g. copper foil) and dielectric layers (e.g. Teflon), which are laminated together with an epoxy resin.",
