    "executive_summary": "Figures have been adjusted for inflation and are presented in 2024 currency. Online automotive parts and accessories retailers have reaped robust growth through the current period, particularly as consumers accept online shopping models. As a result, many traditional brick-and-mortar retailers have invested in omnichannel sales systems that take advantage of their distribution infrastructure. Traditional auto parts retailers with online shopping experiences have been able to fend off fully e-commerce-based companies. Specialization in auto parts and the ability to order online and pick up merchandise in-store have enabled auto parts retailers to capture a growing share of online purchases. Overall, revenue has climbed at an expected CAGR of 5.8% to $6.4 billion through the current period, including a 2.2% jump in 2024, where profit reached 9.8%",
