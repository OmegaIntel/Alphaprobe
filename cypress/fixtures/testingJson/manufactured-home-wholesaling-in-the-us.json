    "executive_summary": "This industry supplies prefabricated homes and various other construction materials to downstream markets, such as dealers, retailers and land developers. Wholesalers' revenue is therefore impacted by the broader downstream construction sector. During the COVID-19 pandemic, as interest rates were lowered, the housing market grew, enabling manufactured home wholesalers to tap into a consistent stream of demand. At the same time, construction activity benefited from high disposable income levels and elevated demand for housing. This trend essentially reversed itself since 2022, as the Federal Reserve has remained committed to raising interest rates to combat high inflation. Despite rising rates, industry revenue still rose at a CAGR of 1.5% to an estimated $35.9 billion in 2024, when revenue is set to rise 1.1% and profit has seen an overall decline.",

The need for tools and materials plummeted due to nationwide business shutdowns and job losses, directly affecting downstream markets. The COVID-19 pandemic drove down the value of private nonresidential construction due to reductions in demand for goods and construction services. The value of residential construction value grew in 2020 and 2021 as low interest rates promoted investment, some of which filtered up to industry wholesalers, who supply a wide range of construction materials."
