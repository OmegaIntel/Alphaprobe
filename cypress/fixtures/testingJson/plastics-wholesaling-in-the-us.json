The industry has historically been vulnerable to economic fluctuations that disrupt its upstream suppliers and downstream buyers, as demonstrated during the pandemic and the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Plastics wholesalers are subject to price changes in plastic materials and resin, contributing to considerable revenue volatility in recent years.",

Successful wholesalers will target competitors operating in new markets and locations. Since wholesalers compete on price and reputation, growing companies can effectively expand economies of scale, offering a competitive pricing model while maintaining a high profit margin."

            "current_performance_point_description": "Volatile input costs and revenue have forced many plastic manufacturers and distributors to alter business strategies. Notably, manufacturers are streamlining relationships with distributors, relying on a single wholesaler to sell their products to potential buyers. These arrangements enable wholesalers to guarantee multiyear supply contracts and become the only distributor carrying that manufacturer's product line. Wholesalers can also provide better customer service and order size flexibility than manufacturers selling directly to customers."

            "current_performance_point_description": "Volatility in the price of plastic materials and resin has widespread implications for plastic manufacturers, influencing the price at which wholesalers purchase these intermediate parts to supply to their downstream markets. Since wholesalers can't immediately reflect these changes in their pricing model or through contracts, maintaining consistent revenue proves difficult."

Paper and metal straw alternatives have grown popular in consumer segments, displacing plastic straws. Similarly, many states and municipalities have banned plastic bags. Wholesalers will rely on innovation from plastic and resin manufacturers."

Funding new projects, like office buildings, homes or manufacturing plants, will continue to grow more expensive. Contractors often purchase large quantities of plastic piping and tubes. Car manufacturers also heavily use resins and other plastics. As interest rates mount, auto loans will become more expensive, limiting demand for new car sales."

A contraction in the world price of crude oil will make plastic production less expensive, placing downward pressure on selling prices. This will threaten growth but cut purchasing costs. This trend will also enable profit to stabilize after declining during the current period."
