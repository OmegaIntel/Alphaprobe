    "executive_summary": "In 2018, CBD products became legal at the federal level. Prior to this, CBD products were illegal at the federal level but legal in many states and with increased frequency. As a result, many areas had a framework in place, so robust growth followed. Still, with states increasingly legalizing CBD products prior to the federal legalization, explosive growth had been ongoing. As the pandemic hit, consumers reduced spending, and CBD producers contended with possibilities of a saturated market. More likely, the industry is normalizing, indicated by relatively slower growth in recent years. Over the past five years, revenue has been growing at a CAGR of 9.6% and is estimated to reach $1.3 billion in 2023 when sales will sink 1.4%.",

As a result, in recent years, growth in the state has outpaced the national average. Still, the aging and normalization of the industry is a positive trend for the top producers. Due to the influx of new players, average profit is slim, weighed down by nonexistent margins of nascent entrants and stymied by overcrowding. As the underperforming players begin falling away and fewer new producers enter the field, profit is expanding"

Some producers will be forced to exit the space, as consumers begin exhibiting brand loyalty toward certain products and businesses emerge as major players in the field. Acquisition activity will likely increase, as established businesses begin making moves to expand and grow their production capacity along with market."

Competition from recreational marijuana dispensaries and other supplement manufacturers will intensify in the coming years, forcing some out of the industry, as sales begin to fall.

International trade is difficult with CBD products, due to domestic and international regulations, which vary significantly. For most producers, tapping a foreign market will be difficult and costly, so trade is expected to remain negligible for most and provide little relief to slowing growth at home."
