            "question": "Has your company purchased any new equipment recently?",
            "answer": "Expenditure on wages in this industry accounts for a much larger portion of revenue than expenditure on capital. However, innovation is necessary to compete with dominant imports."

        {
            "question": "How has your company's growth compared to your main competitors during the period?",
            "answer": "Like most clothing industries, companies compete based largely on price. Marketing products as higher-quality and longer-lasting has allowed some companies to better compete with dominant imports."
        },
        {
            "question": "How has your ability to pass on cost increases to consumers been affected by the global pandemic?",
            "answer": "Average profit has recently suffered from supply chain interruptions and a lack of consumer confidence, limiting the ability to pass on costs. Like most clothing industries, companies compete based largely on price and diminishing consumer sentiment has spurred many losses as companies compete for this reduced demand."

        {
            "question": "How can you boost brand awareness? Have you employed effective social media tactics?",
            "answer": "Manufacturers that produce upscale products need an established brand name and a strong reputation to justify prices. Brand-name companies have been more successful than smaller-name producers, as they need to spend less on marketing to capture limited consumer demand."

            "question": "How much of your revenue is derived from department stores?",
            "answer": "Department and discount department stores are a sizeable downstream market for apparel knitting mills. An increase in demand for apparel and accessories at the retail level translates into demand growth for manufacturers via a hike in order numbers. Demand from department stores is expected to decrease in 2023, posing a potential threat to the industry. Department and discount department stores are the leading retailers of apparel and accessories in the US. Online sales continue to surge in popularity among consumers."

        {
            "question": "Which of your products has been the most resilient to fluctuations in demand? Do you offer any discount products?",

        },
