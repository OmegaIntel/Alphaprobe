High fructose corn syrup (HFCS) is a sweetener made from milled corn that undergoes enzymatic changes to convert glucose into fructose. The resulting syrup is then used as an input in downstream food and beverage production industries, predominantly in soft drinks and processed foods. Overall, industry revenue is anticipated to increase an annualized 1.7% during the period, reaching $4.3 billion in 2022. However, revenue is anticipated to decline of 1.5% in 2022 alone.",
