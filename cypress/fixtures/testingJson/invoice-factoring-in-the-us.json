Greater access to credit has enabled more consumers to use commercial banking and other forms of lending with ease. Since these institutions provide more products and greater stability, many businesses decided to receive funds from them instead of invoice factoring companies, causing revenue for the industry to plunge. COVID-19 also disrupted the industry by disturbing downstream markets and reducing business sentiment, though lower corporate profit constrained external competition. High inflation has been discouraging some corporations from using invoice factoring because of expensive fees.",

This includes better consumer access to financial technology products. More access to credit has raised the borrowing capacity advanced by commercial banks in the form of loans, cash credit and overdrafts.

In turn, this constrained demand for invoice factoring companies in the United States. There was major economic uncertainty during COVID-19, so growth in business sentiment was meager, contributing to declining revenue for the industry in 2020."

Persistent supply chain issues arose since COVID-19 and were exacerbated by the war in Ukraine. Expansive monetary policy and excessive government spending caused demand throughout the economy to surge, contributing to high inflation. Since invoice factoring companies sometimes charge high fees for their services, many businesses have strayed away from using the industry's services to keep their budgets in check, contributing to falling revenue during the current period."

This follows a period of very low borrowing costs since the 2008 financial crisis, specifically during COVID-19. As the cost of borrowing has gone up recently, some businesses and consumers have lost access to traditional financial products. Invoice factoring companies will sell to customers who can't afford the high rates offered to them by commercial banks.

The overall number of establishments will fall by more than 100 from 2023 to 2028. Fewer entrants into the Invoice Factoring industry will hinder internal competition, enabling large players to consolidate and gain more market share. Falling revenue will also encourage smaller businesses to exit the industry, raising consolidation.

Interest rates are projected to be somewhat volatile in the near future, as potential foreign conflicts, political events and trade disputes might encourage the Federal Reserve to alter its policies.

The general public gaining a greater understanding of financial products will spike interest in invoice factoring among some business owners, providing a new revenue stream for the industry during the outlook period. Alternatively, since new and existing financial products will become more advanced because of innovation, they'll take up a larger share of the market in the future.
