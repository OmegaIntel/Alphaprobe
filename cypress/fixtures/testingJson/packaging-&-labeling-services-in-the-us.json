    "executive_summary": "Revenue for the Packaging and Labeling Services industry fluctuates with consumer spending, as service providers earn most of their revenue from contract package and labeling services provided to fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) and pharmaceutical product manufacturers. As US consumption has risen for most of the period, manufacturers have expanded production, increasing the number of products that need to be packaged and thus boosting demand for the industry. Overall, industry revenue is anticipated to have increased an annualized 4.4% to $12.7 billion over the past five years. In 2023, revenue is anticipated to rise 3.3%.",
