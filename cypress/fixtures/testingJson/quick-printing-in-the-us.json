The availability of this technology, combined with swift declines in the price of computer software and peripheral equipment, has hindered shops across the country. Consumers have increasingly favored alternative mediums such as online media and digital communications over printed materials, leeching away the need for quick prints. Overall, revenue is expected to decline at a CAGR of 2.9% during the current period, reaching $4.1 billion in 2023, including a 3.9% decline in 2023 alone. Profit is set to creep downward to 4.7% following rising price competition.",
