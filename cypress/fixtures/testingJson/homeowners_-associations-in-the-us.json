    "executive_summary": "Figures have been adjusted for inflation and are presented in 2024 currency.\n\nThe Homeowners' Associations industry comprises housing management organizations that deliver governance, community and business services to their residents. This industry also includes, to a lesser extent, regulatory athletic associations and sports governing bodies. Over the past five years, industry revenue will grow at a CAGR of 0.2% to $38.2 billion, including a 0.2% growth in 2024 alone. Industry revenue has benefited from growth in per capita disposable income, memberships and the number of housing starts.\n\nMost industry enterprises are structured as nonprofit organizations that reinvest any earned profit into the community. Homeowners' Associations industry organizations typically only generate enough revenue to cover required maintenance, community programs and reserve funding. The majority of industry revenue is generated through assessment fees that residents pay to the association. As a result, revenue growth is primarily driven by increased members, although homeowners' associations will occasionally increase required assessments, if necessary, to cover costs.\n\nOver the next five years, industry revenue will rise at a CAGR of 1.7% to $41.6 billion. The industry will be negatively affected by a slight decline in the homeownership rate, with a portion of new homeowners anticipated to be part of homeowners' associations. Nonetheless, community associations will gain members as more people consider homeowners' associations efficient providers of community services and a way to foster a close sense of community. Furthermore, the industry will receive a boost as the baby boomer generation enters retirement. Community associations are popular among seniors due to the variety of leisure activities and social events that they provide. A gradual employment recovery and consistent disposable income growth will also help drive industry revenue growth over the next five years.",
