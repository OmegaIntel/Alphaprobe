    "executive_summary": "Indoor cycling studios have faced declines over the current period. The outbreak of COVID-19 hammered indoor cycling studios as social distancing and temporary closures led to a drop in memberships. Following the reopening of the economy and vaccine rollouts, pent-up demand led to strong growth in 2021. Still, indoor cycling studios have not fully recovered from pandemic-induced declines over the current period. The rise of at-home cycling classes like Peloton greatly hindered the recovery of indoor cycling studios as many consumers opted to continue using these services even as the economy reopened. Also, the growing popularity of other exercise classes has subdued growth. Revenue has been decreasing at a CAGR of 2.3% to total an estimated $4.4 billion in 2024, including an estimated decrease of 0.6% in 2024 alone. Climbing internal competition led many studios to hike wages to attract and retain skilled instructors, hindering profit growth.",

While some indoor cycling studios began offering online training sessions to stop the bleeding, revenue still plummeted as many consumers began doing other forms of recreation and exercise outdoors amid closures. Some indoor cycling studios lowered prices to retain customers while offering online classes and to attract new customers who canceled memberships as studios began running in person again. While cycling studios enjoyed strong growth in 2021, indoor cycling studios struggled to recover from pandemic-induced declines."

Many consumers began taking at-home fitness classes with companies like Peloton and continued to use those and not renew memberships at indoor cycling studios. The popularity of other fitness classes like Barre has also taken business away from cycling studios. The increase in popularity of at-home fitness classes and other exercise classes has increased competition among indoor cycling studios. Many cycling studios have looked to differentiate themselves by hiring instructors with various certifications. Cycling studios have hiked wages to attract skilled workers, hindering some profit growth."

            "cost_factor_description": "Wages are expected to increase to account for 35.4% of revenue in 2024. While a larger number of cycling studios are nonemployers, wages are high for employers as facilities require constant maintenance, excellent customer service and instructors with certifications. Amid stiff internal competition among cycling studios, many employers have hiked wages to attract and retain skilled instructors, contributing to falling profit. Paying for ongoing training and certifications for instructors have also led to higher wage costs."
