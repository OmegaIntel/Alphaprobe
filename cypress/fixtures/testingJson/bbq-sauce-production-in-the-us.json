    "executive_summary": "The BBQ Sauce Production industry produces liquid or dry seasonings and flavorings. The array of culinary creations incorporating these sauces and rubs shields the industry from economic volatility. As organic foods gain increased traction in the United States, barbecue sauce manufacturers are pivoting to meet demand for all-natural ingredients. Furthermore, the visibility of the industry is boosted by TV shows featuring barbecue competitions. The popularity of outdoor cooking and grilling during COVID-19 led to a revenue boost of 5.6% within the same year. However, decreases in per capita disposable income, reduced meat consumption and dips in the consumer confidence index have negatively impacted revenue.",

And despite the health risks and the connections between high intakes of red meat and heart disease, certain cancers, and type 2 diabetes, per capita meat consumption is expected to increase from 215.2 pounds in 2017 to 218.9 pounds in 2022. According to the Hearth, Patio and Barbecue Association (HPBA), grill and smoker sales are expected to increase over the coming years. According to the HPBA, 70.0% of US adults own a grill or a smoker."

This industry's product is widely available and popular, from barbecue shacks in small towns to national fast-food chains. New products are being brought to the market to fit in with fresh, healthy eating and various tastes. Americans have become more health conscious. Organic barbecue sauce producers can capitalize on this trend because claims of natural and organic ingredients are attractive to these consumers. The industry is moderately concentrated, with the most prominent producers benefiting from economies of scale as they usually have contracts to produce for restaurants and fast food chains and contracts for key inputs."

Typically, the production of barbecue sauce relies much more on quality inputs and production processes than skilled labor; however, companies have recently begun hiring specialized workers to develop new flavors to stay competitive. Barbecue's prominent position in US cuisine helps barbecue sauce producers market themselves successfully in new markets abroad. In contrast, the US appetite for barbecue encourages foreign competitors to send their barbecue products to the United States."
