    "executive_summary": "Online tutoring services boomed through the COVID-19 pandemic as they became the sole option for students looking for help with their coursework. Accordingly, the growing industry saw its strongest revenue growth on record in 2020. Many schools, unable to meet student needs amid teacher layoffs, are leaning heavily on online tutors to help struggling students. Revenue has been surging at a CAGR of 6.9% to an estimated $1.8 billion over the five years through 2024. Revenue will expand by 3.6% in 2024 alone.",

            "current_performance_point_description": "The COVID-19 pandemic forced many schools to embrace online learning in 2020. Most schools continued online learning to mitigate outbreaks in 2021. Online tutors became the only option for students seeking help with their schoolwork. Teachers experienced layoffs and quit in some cases after 2020. Many schools couldn't rehire new teachers to fill in-person positions and meet student needs, leading to rising student-to-teacher ratios that made it difficult for students to get one-on-one help. Online tutors stepped in to address unmet demand for academic assistance."

The latest study reported a drop in math scores for both demographics from 2019 to 2022, the first ever for 9-year-olds. Reading skills also fell over the same period, indicating pandemic-era struggles that weighed on children's ability to learn effectively. Lower-performing students aren't alone in driving the drops in scores. Students across the board are scoring worse on exams, which translates to a larger base of potential students for online tutors to help achieve higher marks."

            "current_performance_point_description": "Educators have embraced high-dose tutoring to address pandemic-era declines in student performance. Under the high-dose method, students meet with tutors one-on-one or in small groups multiple times a week. High-dose tutoring is especially labor-intensive for online providers but fosters a better connection between tutor and student, which can lead to better academic outcomes. The growing popularity of premium high-dose tutoring services helped online tutors generate significant revenue growth through the pandemic."

            "current_performance_point_description": "Highly publicized declines in test scores have pushed many concerned educators away from online tutoring toward high-dose in-person instruction, which is often thought to be more effective. Educated individuals working from home have found a convenient opportunity to make extra money by offering tutoring services online. Online tutors don't necessarily need teaching or tutoring experience to find clients, making it a popular \"side hustle\" for many with a strong academic or professional background. Easy barriers to entry and high demand have made room for a massive influx of new online tutors. Growth in the number of online tutoring services has significantly outpaced revenue growth as new competition forces tutors to offer lower rates. Downward pressure on prices has translated to profit compression for online tutoring services."

            "current_performance_point_title": "Fewer Students Are Pursuing Help With Standardized Tests",
            "current_performance_point_description": "Changing college admission policies have reduced demand for online tutoring services. Ballooning student debt has made many skeptical of college's return on investment, leading to declining enrollment. Smaller classes have sped up a long-term trend of dropping standardized test score requirements. The Supreme Court's decision ending affirmative action and the COVID-19 pandemic pushed colleges away from required test scores even more. Now, over 80.0% of the nation's universities don't require SAT or ACT scores. Disappearing testing requirements translate to lessened demand for help studying for exams. Online tutors generate over a quarter of their revenue through exam preparation courses, so these changes have muted revenue growth."

Online tutoring can put ten teachers in a classroom instead of one. Integrated curricula also ensure tutors don't stray too far from the core curriculum. Tutors will become more familiar with a specific student's curriculum and won't teach any misleading information or outdated methods. More familiarity will tremendously enhance online tutors' quality by reducing the transaction cost of tutors trying to figure out what students have been taught."

Rather than replacing human educators, AI tools are providing them with valuable resources to enhance their teaching tactics. Bots may compete with tutors, but they can also complement tutoring services. Tutors can leverage the power of bots by feeding the computer past homework, textbook chapters and previous lessons, which the bot can then use to develop lesson plans and quizzes based on the student's curriculum and particular needs."

Manageable barriers to entry will make online tutoring attractive as a career, pushing the industry toward market saturation. As schools embrace online tutoring services, some tutoring will be free for parents and students and paid for by the district. School systems can fund the low cost of online tutoring by buying in bulk and securing discounts, giving tutors access to coveted contracts and a reliable revenue stream. Students will have access to more online tutoring services than ever, giving them more power over the industry. Price will become a more critical competitive base, leading to declining hourly rates. Combined with rising wages, online tutors will contend with dropping profit."
