    "executive_summary": "Casino hotels offer short-term lodging and on-site gaming facilities, with some establishments upping the entertainment options, adding luxury services and popular sporting activities. However, hotels were classified as nonessential businesses; as a result, revenue suffered during COVID-19. Even with the many shutdowns across the industry, some hotels were able to mitigate some losses because of the rising trend of online gaming. Even with the sector growing most years in the period, industry revenue declined at a CAGR of 0.8% to $78.6 billion over the past five years, with a 2.0% bump in 2023.",

            "current_performance_point_description": "Aiming to boost revenue streams to fund budgets, state governments highly encouraged casinos to open during the current period as the stigma against gambling declined, leading to heightened gambling tax collections. The prolonged low level of unemployment before the pandemic facilitated rapid wage growth during the current period. Per capita disposable income has grown over the past five years, enabling gamblers to incur higher expenditures on gambling and entertainment activities at casino hotels. And casinos have also benefited from the Supreme Court's decision to strike down the federal ban on sports betting in May 2018, which led to an expanding client base for casino hotel companies."

            "future_outlook_point_description": "States are expected to authorize new casinos to stimulate tourism and benefit from gaming tax revenue. However, with the rising popularity of online gambling and betting, casino hotels must offer fresh incentives to entice gamblers. This digital shift presents unique challenges, like cybersecurity threats, which will add costs to hotel operations and must be addressed to avoid eroding consumer trust in digital platforms. The cost of travel and the rise of staycations will benefit casinos in urban and nearby locations. Finally, in a more distant future, the industry needs to consider competition from AI-powered dealers offering bespoke in-home entertainment experiences."

            "future_outlook_point_title": "Operators Will Roll the Dice on Improving Travel",
            "future_outlook_point_description": "Travel spending is expected to grow with an improving economy and along with residual pent-up demand, increased patronage will be met by increases in the number of enterprises to meet demand, pushing competitive pressures upwards. The number of domestic trips by US residents and inbound trips by non-US residents are expected to jump over the next five years. Inbound trips by non-US residents will encounter substantial growth compared to domestic trips by US residents, as growth in major global economies enables more individuals to visit the United States. However, per capita disposable income will wane and expenditures to entice travelers may not bring the expected return as quickly as needed to boost profit, still behind pre-COVID-19 levels."

Employment is expected to grow as the industry looks to improve the services offered, which will create a better overall experience for patrons but will impact the bottom line and eat into profit. Local casinos that fail to improve amenities will likely see reduced patronage and may be a prime target for acquisition or merger. Increased concentration will benefit the industry, as larger hotels will have fewer competitors, more negotiating power and economies of scale in providing new services that customers seek."

Gamblers will likely choose to save their money for occasional visits to larger gambling destinations such as Las Vegas rather than visiting local casinos at lesser-known locations due to the convenience of online gambling. The impact of online gambling will cannibalize casino gambling and casino hotel visits, in the long run, is still open to debate. Some 2022 evidence from NJ indicates that during a period of increased revenue from internet gambling, in-person gamblers' revenue in Atlantic City casinos was not depressed and saw an increase from the previous year."

Hackers may use bots to gain unfair advantages on gaming sites, launch traffic surges to delay game loading times and gain access to user profiles to perform identity fraud. In 2021, the FBI Cyber Division warned that there was an increase in attacks against tribal casinos, increasing tenfold since 2019. Similar trends are expected to continue and potentially increase."
