    "executive_summary": "The industry produces newsprint, a type of paper packaged in long rolls for use in printing presses. Newspapers and advertisements are most commonly printed on newsprint paper, which is primarily composed of wood pulp. The shift to digital platforms has significantly affected the newsprint industry, with demand for traditional print media plummeting and COVID-19 accelerating the push toward digitalization. Trade tensions and tariffs, notably between the US and Canada, have impacted the industry, increasing costs and affecting imported newsprint availability, causing uncertainty for future operations. Alongside these challenges, companies have had to navigate supply chain disruptions and form flexible strategies amid global unpredictability. Ultimately, industry revenue will contract at a CAGR of 10.9% to $439.8 million over the five years to 2023, including a decline of 0.6% in 2023 alone. Similarly, profit will shrink to 4.5% in 2023, down from 5.4% in 2018.",
