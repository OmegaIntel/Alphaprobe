    "executive_summary": "The Online Sunglasses Sales industry has experienced significant growth over the five years to 2021. Many factors worked in the industry\u2019s favor over the past five years, with revenue increasing at an annualized rate of 8.7% to $1.6 billion in 2021. Rising income levels between 2016 and 2019, coupled with increasing percentage of services conducted online boosted industry revenue over the majority of the period. In 2020, the onset of the COVID-19 (coronavirus) pandemic resulted in significant economic uncertainty, however, industry operators absorbed the majority of demand for industry products as e-commerce sales skyrocketed amid health mandates and store closures. Thus, while overall demand for sunglasses remained relatively steady, industry revenue increased as operators earned sales normally made at brick-and-mortar locations. Although e-commerce sales are expected to subside as consumers resume in-person shopping following vaccine distribution in 2021, industry revenue is forecast to increase 6.8% in 2021.",
