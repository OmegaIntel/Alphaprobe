The industry also includes stores that primarily sell suitcases, backpacks and other kinds of luggage. Over the years to 2024, the industry has fared well, particularly as the number of trips, both foreign and domestic, taken by US residents exhibited strong growth in the first half of the period, driving demand for luggage items. Sharp declines in spending and travel amid the COVID-19 pandemic pressured key markets, but a surge in online shopping habits supported revenue despite the challenging conditions.",
