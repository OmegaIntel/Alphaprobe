    "executive_summary": "Local freight truckers have enjoyed predominantly favorable conditions for both revenue and profitability since 2019, even as input costs swung. Diesel prices surged amid the pandemic's recovery, enabling sharp revenue growth as truckers imposed fuel surcharges. Rising consumer spending and confidence boosted manufacturing activity, which increased demand for truckers to carry input materials and finished products. Still, high interest rates have recently limited freight volumes for truckers carrying industrial products.",

Interest rates reached a 22-year high in 2023, making financing new investments very difficult for businesses across the economy. Many local freight truckers carry freight intended for use in construction or mining industries. As these end users slow operations and avoid expanding, manufacturing companies cut production and operate at lower capacity. Logistics companies saw dampened demand and smaller freight volumes in 2023."

Manufacturing industries raised production capacities to service heightened demand. More manufacturing activity means more trucks are needed to bring input materials to factories and carry finished products to wholesalers and retailers, boosting revenue for local freight trucking companies."

Fuel surcharges bring revenue growth, though truckers usually can't pass costs fully downstream. As pent-up demand for industrial production and travel was released in 2021, the price of fuel skyrocketed. Local freight truckers successfully passed these heightened input costs on to clients in 2021 and 2022, perpetuating already-surging industry revenue."
