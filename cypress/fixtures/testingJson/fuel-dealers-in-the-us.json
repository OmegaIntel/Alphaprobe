    "executive_summary": "Fuel dealers have exhibited revenue growth as demand has remained stable and oil and natural gas prices have fluctuated favorably. However, the COVID-19 pandemic disrupted demand for fuel from commercial and industrial operations as they shuttered or operated at reduced capacity. Oil prices plummeted amid the suspension of most travel and revenue plunged in 2020. Oil consumption from consumers quarantined at home helped stave off more severe losses, but this boon was dampened as most states were getting warmer through the height of stay-at-home ordinances. The Russia-Ukraine war has caused oil prices to surge since early 2022, but revenue has begun to decline again as production catches up. Revenue for fuel dealers is expected to climb at a CAGR of 2.9% to $49.0 billion through the end of 2024, including growth of 1.7% in 2024 alone.",

            "current_performance_point_description": "Many consumers have annual contracts with fuel dealers to supply home heating fuel, making it a non-discretionary purchase. This typically protects fuel dealers from volatility, but the pandemic brought an atypical drop in fuel sales. Business closures and shelter-in-place orders substantially reduced demand from commercial customers. Household demand somewhat buoyed revenue, though, as consumers spent much more time at home and used more fuel."

While an increase in the number of housing starts typically helps fuel dealers, newly built homes in areas recently supplied by gas distribution networks may be more conducive to natural gas use because of price differentials."

Oil prices will continue to be volatile and are expected to climb because of the Palestine-Israel war. To counter this problem, fuel dealers must secure long-term supply contracts that shield themselves from future crude oil and natural gas price increases."

            "question": "How much revenue do you lose to utilities-based substitute products? Do you have long-term supply contracts in place to protect demand?",
            "answer": "Fuel dealers compete with utility providers, especially for electricity and natural gas, to provide consumers with power for heating and cooking purposes. Fuel products have an advantage in geographic areas where electricity or natural gas is not easily provided. More specifically, this industry is dominated by regional-specific heating needs, like heating oil for the northeast and electricity for the south."

            "question": "How much do you rely on residential demand? Do you actively monitor population and construction trends to anticipate new trends?",
            "answer": "The residential market represents the industry's largest source of demand for propane, other liquefied petroleum gases and heating oil. As the number of houses rises, revenue rises as well to meet the water and central heating needs of these new homes. However, these new home constructions also can present a threat to the industry since they are often fitted with more efficient, environmentally-friendly natural gas hookups."
        },
        {
            "question": "Do you monitor the price of crude oil? How do you minimize the impact of oil price volatility on your revenue and profit?",
            "answer": "Since demand for propane and heating oil is relatively inflexible, higher crude oil prices tend to expand industry revenue in the short term. However, should fuel prices rise to prohibitive levels, this may encourage customers to retrofit their homes and reduce demand."
