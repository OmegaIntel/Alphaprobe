    "executive_summary": "The increase in the number of eating disorder cases has stimulated industry growth and supported the emergence of substitute services. However, many individuals still don't receive treatment because of high costs, lack of awareness and the stigma around seeking help. Public and private health insurers often provide limited coverage or exclude eating disorder treatments, creating financial barriers and hindering industry growth. Although social media and online platforms have increased public awareness and provided services, social media is criticized for diminishing the positive impact of these efforts. Legislative efforts are underway to hold platforms accountable for any mental harm or the promotion of eating disorders. Despite these challenges, positive economic factors such as increased government funding and higher per capita income have contributed to industry revenue growing at a CAGR of 1.9%, reaching a total of $4.5 billion in 2024 and an estimated revenue gain of 0.9%.",

Clinics can offer advanced therapies such as VR immersion and genetic testing, which these alternatives lack. Nonetheless, many individuals remain unable to afford treatment until mental health parity laws are enforced. Innovative treatments enhance the value of higher-priced services, but competition for skilled workers like therapists, nurses and doctors keeps wages high, preventing clinics from lowering prices to attract consumers."

Virtual therapy sessions provide access to care for individuals in remote or underserved areas and may improve patient adherence to treatment plans. The increased use of digital health tools (mobile apps and online platforms) can support ongoing therapy, self-monitoring and patient engagement. These tools differentiate clinics from substitute providers as the tools provide supplementary resources and facilitate continuous support outside traditional in-person sessions. The use of advanced data analytics to track patient progress, outcomes and overall treatment effectiveness is expected to climb."

To complement increased awareness, public health campaigns, social media advocacy and celebrity endorsements have played crucial roles in destigmatizing eating disorders and encouraging individuals to seek help. Clinics are adapting their treatment approaches to align with the body positivity and anti-diet culture movements, reflecting evolving attitudes toward body image. There is growing recognition that eating disorders impact diverse populations, leading clinics to specialize and market services to underserved groups."

A negligible increase in the unemployment rate will leave the numbers with private health insurance generally unchanged, with those lacking coverage looking to a larger store of personal funds. Growth in federal funding for Medicare and Medicaid will support demand for services because continued robust government funding has the potential to expand coverage for existing programs and boost reimbursements. Expanding interest in the industry by private equity firms will likely continue to drive change, with the number of industry establishments and industry employment growing."

This shift in societal perception encourages individuals to seek industry services help without fear of judgment.

Legislative measures such as the Mental Health Parity and Addiction Equity Act are playing a crucial role in expanding insurance coverage for eating disorder treatments. This legislative support ensures that more individuals can access necessary care without facing prohibitive costs. Governments are implementing regulations that require social platforms to monitor and eliminate advertisements and content that promote eating disorders.
