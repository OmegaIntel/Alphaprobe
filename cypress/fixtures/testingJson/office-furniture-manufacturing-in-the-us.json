    "executive_summary": "Office furniture manufacturing has endured significant volatility, with revenue declining over the years leading up to 2024. Macroeconomic instability in recent years \u2013 including spiking unemployment, jumping interest rates, rising office rental vacancies and declining value of private nonresidential construction \u2013 have contributed to weaker demand for new office furniture. Similarly, work-from-home and hybrid working trends have harmed demand for domestic producers. Basic, low-cost, mass-produced furniture items endure heightened competition from more affordable imports, particularly those from China. At the same time, exports have declined amid the recent appreciation of the US dollar. These trends have caused revenue to weaken at an estimated CAGR of 2.6% to $29.2 billion, including a minor gain of 0.1% that year alone.",

            "question": "How is your company impacted by rising imports from abroad?",

            "question": "Has your company been exposed to volatile input prices over the past few years?",
            "answer": "The price of steel has been volatile, partly due to tariffs implemented on imported steel. Lumber and metal prices often fluctuate based on demand and other trade conditions. As a result, furniture manufacturers are susceptible to volatile input prices."

        {
            "question": "Have you been able to reduce wage costs by automating operations over the past five years?",
            "answer": "As the industry has placed a greater emphasis on customization, it hasn't been able to automate the manufacturing process, driving wage costs higher."

        {
            "question": "How does your company stay ahead of regulations?",
            "answer": "The industry is not heavily regulated. Manufacturers' exposure is largely determined by the extent of local environmental regulations and having to ensure the products meet quality standards."

        {
            "question": "What effect have international tariffs had on your ability to import and export products?",

        {
            "question": "Do you maintain good relationships with key suppliers? Do you have a steady list of contracts/suppliers?",
            "answer": "Having established links with key suppliers enables a steady flow of key inputs and price locks, which may provide cost savings for bulk purchases. Manufacturers without strong relationships with suppliers are susceptible to fluctuations in input prices, driving operating costs higher."

            "question": "How do you keep up to date with office furniture trends?",

            "question": "What training process do your employees undergo? Are your employees high-skilled workers?",
            "answer": "A highly trained workforce is essential for office furniture manufacturers, as many of the goods produced in the industry are custom-made pieces that require quality workmanship."
        },
        {
            "question": "How have fluctuations in the value of the US dollar affected demand for your products? How do you plan to mitigate the threat of imports?",
            "answer": "As the value of the dollar declines, it leads to lower relative export prices and higher import prices, benefiting industry revenue. A strong US dollar, on the other hand, negatively impacts demand for domestically produced furniture, harming demand for US manufacturers. Since downstream buyers are often price-conscious, they are more likely to purchase affordable pieces."
        },
        {
            "question": "How do you anticipate corporate profit might impact your company's sales projections?",
            "answer": "Corporate profit determines a company's available budget for office furniture and other related purchases. When earnings are high, companies are more likely to purchase new furniture."
        },
        {
            "question": "Do you track the national unemployment rate? How has an increasing unemployment rate decreased demand for your company's products?",
            "answer": "When unemployment is high, demand for new furniture declines as office vacancies rise and fewer employees are hired. A lower unemployment rate often translates to higher demand for commercial real estate, creating a need for office furniture."
