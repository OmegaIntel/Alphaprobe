    "executive_summary": "HVAC franchises install, repair and run maintenance for heating, ventilation and air-conditioning (HVAC) and refrigeration systems. Demand for HVAC franchises is derived from two main downstream markets, the residential and nonresidential markets. Through the end of 2023, the residential market has experienced booming growth as low interest rates and COVID-19 influenced high demand for new housing and investment in existing housing. HVAC installation, repair and maintenance is required at all these junctures, boosting demand for HVAC franchises. The second market is nonresidential; this market faced severe conditions through COVID-19 since most businesses had to close to stop the spread of the virus.",

This meant businesses were less likely to expand operations, and consumers were less likely to buy a house. With heightened rates, the cost of borrowing to finance a new house or office building increased significantly. Shying away from both markets, in turn, depresses demand for HVAC services."

Revenue for many businesses and corporations proceeded to plummet, which severely reduced spending on constructing office buildings and other nonresidential structures, causing demand for HVAC franchises to decline precipitously. COVID-19 also encouraged consumers to spend less on items such as refrigerators, which led to less contracting work to install these devices. The recovery led to a resurgence in these markets, but the nonresidential sector remains muted."

New systems will be needed due to this, giving HVAC franchises a massive downstream market moving forward.
