Revenue and profit sunk drastically as prices plummeted amid the pandemic. Manufacturers saw the need for lubricants slump as stay-at-home orders cut the need for automobiles, minimizing oil changes. The lone bright spot for manufacturers during this time was the essential industrial markets that remained open. As the economy reopened and crude oil production resumed, prices shot back up, allowing manufacturers to climb back up from the pandemic downturns.",
