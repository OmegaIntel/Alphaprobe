    "executive_summary": "Auto windshield repair service providers primarily engage in replacing, repairing and tinting automotive glass. While some repairs are essential for vehicle safety, the majority of repairs, replacements and tinting jobs rely on economic conditions. Strong per capita disposable income and consumer confidence will encourage nonessential auto windshield repair services. Consumers may defer repairs during periods of economic uncertainty. Even so, large companies managed to carry revenue through the pandemic, relying on value-added services, like mobile replacements, to generate revenue. Revenue ballooned at an expected CAGR of 4.4% to $8.5 billion through the current period, including a 0.9% jump in 2024, where profit reached 13.2%.",

            "current_performance_point_description": "Most states deemed car repair shops, including auto windshield repair services, essential during the pandemic, permitting these businesses to remain open amid quarantine and lockdown restrictions. Still, lower driving activity and depressed driving activity encouraged consumers to delay nonessential repairs. Larger auto windshield repair services largely carried growth through the pandemic; these providers often offer value-added services with greater convenience, like mobile repairs, enabling them to capture more market share and protect against downturns."

            "current_performance_point_title": "Supply chain disruptions challenged auto windshield repair services",
            "current_performance_point_description": "Long lead times for upstream glass manufacturers following the pandemic and the Russian invasion of Ukraine created rippling supply chain disruptions. Auto glass prices climbed significantly, threatening bottom lines. Many windshield repair shops, especially those with lower economies of scale, reported multiple-week backorders for windshields and windows, with prices for related sealants and auto parts also skyrocketing. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, motor vehicle part prices increased 5.2%, while adhesives and sealant costs ballooned 14.2% between 2021 and 2022."

            "current_performance_point_description": "As federal, state and local governments lifted lockdown restrictions following the pandemic, many consumers expressed pent-up demand for entertainment, travel and other recreation options. This trend contributed to a notable uptick in driving activity. In particular, motor vehicle registrations, car sales and vehicle miles skyrocketed in 2021. Increased driving activity also caused vehicle accidents to climb more than 16.0% in the same year. Similarly, higher new car prices encouraged buyers to switch to used vehicles; used cars are more likely to require windshield replacements before sale, boosting demand for auto repair services."

Even so, more cars manufactured with advanced driver-assistance systems (ADAS) will reduce the total number of vehicle collisions. For example, automakers and safety regulators estimate that cars outfitted with forward collision warning and automatic emergency braking will lower rear-end collisions by more than 49.0%. Similarly, these safety systems will limit the severity of most collisions, potentially reducing damage to windshields and making expensive replacements less common."

            "future_outlook_point_title": "Advanced windshields will carry higher replacement costs",
            "future_outlook_point_description": "Advanced windshields often require sensors and cameras embedded into auto glass, making the process of replacing a windshield more complex and costly. Repairers often turn to aftermarket parts to reduce costs, but many top car manufacturers, like Ford and Honda, advise against aftermarket windshields in cars fitted with ADAS. Even so, companies have been able to charge consumers and insurance more for advanced windshield repair and replacement. Kelly Blue Book has reported that ADAS windshield repair costs have eclipsed $1,000 for replacements, averaging $1,600 for advanced models. By comparison, traditional windshield repairs cost $300 to $500."

Many companies, particularly small businesses and nonemployers, will join franchises to gain access to a wider network and more resources. Even so, small, regional repair shops will struggle against Safelite and other large franchises. Consumers have increasingly preferred convenience, preferring same-day mobile services; most small businesses lack the economic scale to offer inexpensive, convenient services."
