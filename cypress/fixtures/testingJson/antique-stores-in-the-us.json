    "executive_summary": "While initially challenging, the past five years have been lucrative for antique stores. The onset of COVID-19 halted essential foot traffic and brought a drop in revenue, but these challenges were offset by the following year's gains. The roll-out of vaccines and the relaxation of social distancing guidelines released pent-up demand, reigniting the industry's growth as both old and new antique enthusiasts could return to stores. Sustainability concerns and trending interior design styles have continued to fuel interest in antiques, and significant price hikes have created robust gains in industry revenue year after year.",

Antique stores benefitted from a surge in revenue in 2021 as vaccines rolled out and pent-up demand was released."
