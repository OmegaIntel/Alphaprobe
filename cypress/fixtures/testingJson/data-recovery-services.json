Although the increasing number of households with at least one computer and the rising popularity of electronic devices were expected to provide ample demand for industry services, options for data recovery and data loss prevention have expanded in recent years, and demand for industry services has declined. Over the five years to 2020, industry revenue is estimated to fall an annualized 9.5% to $9.1 million, with an expected decline of 14.2% in 2020 alone, accelerated by the effects of the COVID-19 (coronavirus) pandemic. Furthermore, profit is expected to contract sharply to a period low as well due to increased price competition and poor macroeconomic conditions caused by the pandemic.",
