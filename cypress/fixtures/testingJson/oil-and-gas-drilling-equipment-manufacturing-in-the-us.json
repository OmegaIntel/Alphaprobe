    "executive_summary": "Major global events, like the pandemic and the Ukraine war, have negatively impacted machinery manufacturers by creating significant volatility in commodity prices. Major production and travel slowdowns harmed demand for oil and gas, resulting in fewer extraction projects and lowering the need for machinery. Although prices bounced back as the economy re-opened, many oil and gas companies turned to imported machinery, which is more affordable. The Ukraine war, however, disrupted the global oil and gas supply chain, boosting demand for domestic production. Overall, revenue has been falling at a CAGR of 3.4% over the past five years to total an estimated $14.0 billion through the end of 2024, including an estimated decrease of 1.8% in 2024.",
