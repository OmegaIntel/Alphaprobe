    "executive_summary": "Figures have been adjusted for inflation and are presented in 2021 currency.\n\nThe Pool and Billiard Halls industry is composed of operators that provide a space for consumers to play pool and other cue sports. Pool and billiard halls typically charge customers by the hour to use tables, with fees that generally range between $6.00 and $12.00. However, some pool halls may also maintain coin-operated pool tables, in which minimal staff supervision is needed. Additionally, pool halls operate arcade games, prize machines and gear and merchandise sales, which provide another source of revenue for industry operators. Lastly, pool and billiard halls often sell food and beverages to customers, with operations that range from packaged snacks and vending machines to a full-service bar and restaurant.\n\nOver most of the five years to 2021, most macroeconomic factors affecting the industry demonstrated positive growth. Per capita disposable income grew and consumer confidence in the economy sharply increased, causing consumers to liberally spend on discretionary activities, such as sports and entertainment. Nevertheless, the industry has experienced steady declines, with revenue suffering primarily due to increased external competition from video games, mobile devices and related industries, such as bowling centers, family fun centers and others. Moreover, in 2020, industry revenue and profit are expected to suffer from the mandatory closure of nonessential businesses.",
