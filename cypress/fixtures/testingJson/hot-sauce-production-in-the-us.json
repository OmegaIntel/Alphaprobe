Positive demographic consumption trends and a growing assortment of product varieties have boosted hot sauce demand through 2024. Although the domestic market has become somewhat saturated, the popularity of spicy food has continued to grow. The industry will expand at an expected CAGR of 2.7% to $2.7 billion over the five years to 2024, including a 0.9% jump in 2024. Even so, rising competition and swelling wage costs characterize the industry, limiting profit to 3.6% in 2024.",
