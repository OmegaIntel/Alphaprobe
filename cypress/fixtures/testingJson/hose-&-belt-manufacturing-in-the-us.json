Transportation, automotive and general industrial manufacturers, alongside oil, gas and food service industries, are extremely common buyers of hoses and belts. In general, the industry has exhibited solid post-pandemic growth. Rebounding industrial production, robust vehicle sales and recovering consumer markets have offset uncertainty and elevated interest rates, leading to steady growth. Overall, revenue has expanded at an expected CAGR of 0.7% to $6.7 billion through the current period, including a 0.4% increase in 2024, where profit reached 7.7%.",

In general, higher crude oil prices have translated into more expensive plastic and rubber inputs. Even so, leading manufacturers have leveraged extensive supply chain connections, globalization efforts and strong reputations to limit costs and pass higher prices relatively seamlessly onto buyers. Also, rubber prices have declined following 2021, enabling companies to cut prices. This practice has led to a wider range of available buyers, leading to strong post-pandemic profit growth."

This trend has forced domestic manufacturers to pivot toward more niche markets that favor custom-built solutions. These markets more heavily prioritize quality, longevity and customization with less emphasis on price. These markets generally face less pressure from foreign competitors, leading to more stable growth. Even so, the dollar's appreciation poses a major threat to domestic markets. Imports have grown even less expensive, causing import penetration to eclipse 55.0%"

In particular, economic uncertainty has diminished demand for new vehicles and machinery, cutting into demand for first-fit hoses and belts. Instead, weak conditions have led to more repairs, supporting demand for replacements from power transmission and fluid power markets. Even so, most markets display highly cyclical repair and replacement cycles; this trend leads to largely stable growth, aside from the pandemic."
