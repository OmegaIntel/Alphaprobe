    "executive_summary": "Figures have been adjusted for inflation and are presented in 2024 currency. Cheese producers endured a slight dip in revenue through the end of 2024, despite slightly higher per capita dairy consumption and boosting milk prices. Despite high sales amid strengthening milk prices, cheese production revenue and profit have been pressured by rising operational costs, including input purchase and labor costs. Nonetheless, cheese producers' revenue loss over the last five years was minimal because cheese is an essential part of the American diet. Another contributing factor to low revenue contraction was heightened per capita disposable income that encouraged some consumers to trade up on cheese products. Overall, revenue is expected to inch down at a CAGR of 0.4% over the past five years to $62.6 billion, including a 0.4% contraction in 2024 alone.",

This compelled cheese producers to raise their selling prices. Despite the price hikes, consumers largely maintained their cheese purchases, as it remains a staple in American diets, showcasing the strong inelastic demand for cheese. Although revenue contracted, heightened selling prices helped to somewhat offset the increased operating costs, which cushioned the revenue drop. Despite profit drops over the past five years, these boosted prices limited revenue decline."
