Restrictions on nonessential businesses caused a significant downturn in 2020, as many establishments found operating impossible. Bars and nightclubs have traditionally revolved around in-person experiences, severely curtailed by public health measures and social distancing guidelines. Relaxed social distancing rules renewed the public's appetite for in-person socializing. This, coupled with the resilience of bars and nightclubs, has fueled a resurgence. The industry has seen an annualized growth of 1.9% over the past five years. Revenue will reach $37.8 billion by 2024, including an increase of 0.6% in 2024 alone.",

Profits are expected to slip even further as operational costs continue to escalate, and passing these costs onto the customers risks losing business due to inflated prices. Given the service-focused nature of these businesses, options to trim wage costs are limited, particularly as wages are projected to account for a larger share of revenue.
