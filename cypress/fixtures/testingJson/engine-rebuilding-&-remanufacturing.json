    "executive_summary": "The Engine Rebuilding and Remanufacturing industry tends to run counter to typically positive economic indicators. When consumer income levels are high, demand tends to fall because consumers favor new car purchases over rebuilt or remanufactured engines. Over the five years to 2019, rising disposable income levels and improved consumer confidence have supported new car purchases, which has stifled industry demand. In contrast, rebounding industrial and heavy manufacturing activity over the past five years has helped boost demand for remanufactured diesel engines from heavy industrial and construction customers.",
