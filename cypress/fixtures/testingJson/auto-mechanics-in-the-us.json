    "executive_summary": "Auto mechanics provide mechanical and electrical repair and maintenance for a variety of vehicles, including cars, trucks and vans. Over the five years to 2023, the industry experienced moderate growth. The number of vehicles on the road has expanded, along with the average age of the vehicle fleet, however a fall in consumer confidence has made consumers postpone car repair and maintenance services. Revenue growth was significantly disrupted in 2020 by the outbreak of COVID-19, as a sharp decline in total vehicle mileage reduced the need for car repairs overall. Revenue quickly recovered, supported by rising consumer confidence levels. Overall, revenue is expected to rise at a CAGR of 0.5% to $81.7 billion over the five years to 2023, including an increase of 1.7% in 2023.",
