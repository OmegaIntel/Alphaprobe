            "answer": "General, truckload freight truckers depend on manufacturing, retail and trade markets to generate demand for their services. These markets are driven by discretionary spending. Discretionary spending fell sharply in 2020, during the pandemic, but rebounded in 2021, as a result of an economic recovery."
        },
        {
            "question": "Are your company's sales heavily dependent on total trade value?",
            "answer": "Trade is an important market for industry truckers who often transport goods to and from US ports. The pandemic caused some sizable supply-chain disruptions and limited consumer spending, reducing US and global trade flows sharply in 2020. However this was reversed in 2021, as the economy reopened."
        },
        {
            "question": "Has your company been exposed to volatile crude oil prices over the past few years?",
            "answer": "A sizable portion of industry revenue is earned through fuel surcharges, which are determined by crude oil prices. Their slump in 2020 resulted in declining revenue for industry services. This was compounded by the coronavirus pandemic."
        },
        {
            "question": "How have you handled the adjustment to new regulatory standards such as ELDs?",
            "answer": "Electronic Logging Devices (ELDs) are an electronic hardware attachment that records driving hours. Intended to implement safer driving-hour regulations, they have limited the operable hours available to truck drivers."

        {
            "question": "How have volatile input prices affected profit margins over the past year?",
            "answer": "Volatile input prices have helped industry profitability, but the mechanisms in the industry to handle these price changes have been strained by the volatility."

        {
            "question": "How do you balance price rates to stimulate demand? Who is your biggest competition in pricing?",
            "answer": "Tight financial control over costs and revenue, especially debt collection and overhead, is important to plan cash flows. The pandemic put a sizable strain on industry businesses and reduced the average industry profit margin. Balancing debt and pricing was crucial to success last year and will be vital as the industry recovers from the pandemic."

        {
            "question": "Do you monitor the fluctuations in the price of diesel? How much of your revenue is derived from additional fuel surcharges?",
            "answer": "The cost of fuel heavily impacts industry costs, which are highly volatile due to environmental, economic and geopolitical factors. During periods of high fuel prices, industry profit margins often decline. However, industry operators typically implement fuel surcharges to offset rising costs and generate additional revenue, minimizing lost profitability. In 2020, the price of fuel plummeted during the pandemic, however it rebounded significantly in 2021, aiding revenue growth."

        {
            "question": "Do you keep track of the industrial production index? How do fluctuations affect your company?",
            "answer": "Industrial activity drives demand for the transportation of finished products as well as inputs for further production. Consequently, increased industrial activity, which includes manufacturing, mining and utility output, boosts demand for industry services. The industrial production index fell sizably in 2020, however it rebounded in 2021, and is expected to rise in 2022."
        },
        {
            "question": "Do you expect changes in demand as a result of changing disposable income levels? How can you adjust your supply to account for these changes?",
            "answer": "Consumer spending reflects growing demand for goods and services, thereby driving retail and manufacturing activity. Consequently, an increase in spending also leads to an additional need for the movement of general truckload freight, boosting demand for industry services. Consumer spending, which is crucial for industry demand, is expected to rise in 2022, as a result of a recovering economy."
