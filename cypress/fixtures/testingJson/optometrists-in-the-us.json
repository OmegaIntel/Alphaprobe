Aside from this, optometrists benefit from a stable patient base, as nearly three-quarters of the US population uses a form of corrective eyewear. Rising incomes have facilitated access to optometrists as larger incomes allow patients to cover out-of-pocket costs since public and private insurance payers often limit vision benefits.",
