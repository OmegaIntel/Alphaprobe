    "executive_summary": "Figures have been adjusted for inflation and are presented in 2024 currency.\n\nFire and smoke alarm manufacturers produce fire detection and alarm systems. Construction activity, especially nonresidential construction, primarily drives revenue since commercial, industrial and institutional buyers are the industry's largest markets. Manufacturers have combated volatile conditions through the current period. The pandemic created unprecedented uncertainty, slamming nonresidential construction and industrial production despite robust residential construction markets. Even as critical markets recovered, supply chain disruptions and climbing interest rates prevented manufacturers from fully recouping losses from 2020. Overall, revenue contracted at an estimated CAGR of 0.8% to $1.5 billion through the current period, despite a 0.6% jump in 2024, where profit reached 11.4%.\n\nCompanies have endured notable supply chain volatility due to the pandemic and the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Higher costs have pressured most fire and smoke alarm manufacturers, leading to elevated purchasing costs. Even so, leading producers were able to leverage brand reputations and long-term contracts to mitigate costs and expand profit. Manufacturers have also faced mounting pressure from imports, particularly from low-cost producers in Mexico, China and Malaysia. Companies have managed to thrive in higher-end, custom-built markets, mitigating this threat.",
