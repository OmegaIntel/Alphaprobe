The industry has benefited as interest in agritourism has risen, driven by consumers' interest in connecting with the food supply chain as concerns about sustainability have grown. Farms have sought to expand their agritourism services from simple direct-to-consumer sales and education to entertainment activities like petting zoos and even higher revenue accommodation offerings. This has propelled the industry to grow at a CAGR of 3.6% to $1.7 billion over the past five years, including an expected boost of 3.0% in 2024.",

With greater disposable income to spend, these groups will seek out unique experiences at tourist farms and petting zoos. Eager to diversify revenue streams by adding new services, ever more farms will expand into the industry, with many seeking subsidies at all levels of government. Consequently, revenue is expected to shoot up at a CAGR of 3.2% to $2.0 billion over the next five years."

Petting zoos and tourist farms faced difficult conditions during the COVID-19 pandemic, as shutdowns and distancing measures forced businesses to close for much of 2020. In turn, revenue contracted and profit likewise cratered as consumers stayed away from in-person activities. However, agritourism was perceived as a safe recreational activity following the outset of the COVID-19 pandemic because most activities take place outdoors. So farms saw a boom in demand, with revenue jumping nearly 50.0% in 2021 alone. With industry establishments rushing to expand services in line with unprecedented demand, profit margins quickly eclipsed their pre-pandemic levels."
