    "executive_summary": "The Media Representative Firms industry consists of companies that primarily sell media time for media owners. A shift away from traditional media has led corporations to spend larger portions of their advertising budgets on digital media sources, expediting revenue growth. Industry enterprises have increasingly provided representation for online media sites, although many digital media companies opt to sell their advertising space internally and bypass the need for industry services. While online advertisements tend to be less valuable than advertisements on traditional media due to reduced commissions and revenue, demand from this market has grown exponentially. As digital advertising has grown in popularity, the pandemic led to a simultaneous sharp contraction in print advertising.",

At the expense of traditional print advertisers, demand has turned in favor of online markets, fueling revenue growth within the expanding digital media and advertising space. Corporations have diverted increased portions of their advertising budgets to digital media and away from radio, TV, print and other media advertising, which have historically dominated industry revenue generation."

Contracts for print media representation have declined as consumers have increasingly shifted away from buying print magazines and newspapers. Direct mail and other forums for print advertising have also waned in popularity. To offset this plummet, digital advertising expenditure has significantly increased, constituting an increasing share of total advertising expenditure."
