    "executive_summary": "Figures have been adjusted for inflation and are presented in 2024 currency. Over the past five years, rising disposable income and a temporary spike in the marriage rate didn't do much to support demand for event planners, as most consumers and businesses lost their footing following a period of economic volatility. When social distancing guidelines eased, party and event planners experienced a moderate surge as clients who postponed their events during the pandemic were eager to celebrate. This temporary advancement was not enough for party planners to significantly recover, with revenue rising at a CAGR of just 0.1% over the past five years. Revenue will total $6.8 billion in 2024, when it will contract 0.8%.",

Industry revenue is expected to expand at a CAGR of 0.7% to $7.1 billion through the end of 2029. Reduced consumer confidence is detrimental to party and event planners. When consumer confidence fluctuates, consumers prefer to personally plan events to save on the cost of hiring professional event planners."

Businesses seek the services of event planners for holiday parties, fundraisers and client appreciation banquets. Instability in the economy leads to reduced corporate spending. A growth in corporate profit typically supports growth for event planners, but only when business is going well. Despite greater profit, corporations have limited spending on nonessential events."

Despite this, a surge in weddings in 2021 and 2022 benefitted party and event planners and boosted revenue. Young adults are increasingly delaying marriage as changing social norms put less pressure on individuals to commit to one life-long partner. As weddings are typically costly, an uptick is a great opportunity for party planners, bolstering performance."
