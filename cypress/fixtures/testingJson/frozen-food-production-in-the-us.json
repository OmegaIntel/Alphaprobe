With more money to spend, some consumers have opted for fresh produce over frozen varieties, stifling expansion. Mounting health concerns have also led some consumers to purchase fewer frozen foods, which are often perceived as less healthy than fresher meals, despite new studies indicating otherwise. Frozen food producers have responded by introducing products with healthier, more nutritious ingredients.",

Consumers have also become expansively aware of the high sodium content of some frozen prepared meals, weakening demand for these products through the end of 2024. This trend has been more significant for the frozen pizza segment, within which the inherently starchy and high-sodium nature of frozen pizza has challenged frozen food producers."
