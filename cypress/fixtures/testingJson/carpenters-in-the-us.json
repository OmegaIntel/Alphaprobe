Despite initial growth because of increased housing starts and private spending on home improvements, subsequent interest rate hikes limited this upward trend. While the post-pandemic demand in the commercial market helped balance declines in residential construction, office construction has maintained a sluggish pace, primarily because of high rental vacancies. Public funding for hospital construction added some impetus, but growth in other municipal building constructions remained slow.",

This, together with rising disposable income, will stimulate private spending on home improvements.

As a rule of thumb, when mortgage rates are low, there tends to be a surge in home-building activity, amplifying work opportunities for carpenters. Personal disposable income levels have a part to play. A rise in disposable income usually infers greater private spending on home improvements, driving demand in the residential construction market."
