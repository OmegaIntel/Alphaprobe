    "executive_summary": "Hydroponic growing equipment stores have experienced robust expansion, growing at a CAGR of 3.0% to $2.0 billion over the past five years, including an increase of 0.6% in 2024 alone. This growth has been driven by increased consumer interest in healthful eating and organic produce, resulting in a surge in demand from hydroponic food crop farmers. These farmers, operating small-scale regional growing operations, have turned to hydroponic methods to produce organic-standard crops. The industry has also experienced a rise in demand from individuals and small farms looking to set up their own hydroponic greenhouses for organic food production. Furthermore, the industry has benefited from growing demand from recreational and medical marijuana growers, which has significantly boosted sales of hydroponic growing equipment.",
