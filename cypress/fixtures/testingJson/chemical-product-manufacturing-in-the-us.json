    "executive_summary": "Figures have been adjusted for inflation and are presented in 2024 currency. Chemical product manufacturers have had to contend with uneven demand over the past five years, but changes in commodity prices have still allowed revenue growth for the industry. While the price of oil dropped as travel dropped off amid the COVID-19 pandemic, prices skyrocketed in the years following as pent-up demand was released. The Russian invasion of Ukraine led many nations to impose sanctions that cut the world supply of oil, exacerbating the increase in input costs for chemical product manufacturers even more. These heightened prices were successfully passed on to downstream industries through price increases.",
