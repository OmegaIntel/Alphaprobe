    "executive_summary": "For most of the five years to 2022, the Coffee Store Franchises industry has experienced robust growth as the franchise model continued to be a popular method for large chains to expand its company footprint with relatively low capital investment. The largest industry player, Dunkin' Brands Group Inc. (Dunkin'), has added more than 1,500 franchises to its network during the current period, expanding into underrepresented regions relative to its traditional stronghold in the Northeast. Although rising consumer spending and improving economic conditions encouraged industry revenue growth during most of the period, the COVID-19 (coronavirus) pandemic and accompanying public mandates limiting public activity stifled industry revenue in 2020. Over the five years to 2022, IBISWorld expects industry revenue to grow an annualized 2.4% to $12.7 billion, including an estimated increase of 6.1% in 2022 alone. However, it is anticipated that industry profit will fall to 4.4% of industry revenue in 2022.",
