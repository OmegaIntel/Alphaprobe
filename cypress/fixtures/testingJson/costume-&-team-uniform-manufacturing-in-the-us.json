These two product segments cater to, at times, the same types of customers but in different ways. Parents' investment in children's theater and sports participation, reflected by costumes and uniform purchases, remains highly discretionary. People must purchase academic gowns for graduation ceremonies, even at elevated prices. A spike in unemployment and canceled children's activities followed the onset of COVID-19, to the detriment of costume and tem uniform manufacturers. 2021's reopening outpaced manufacturing and commodity supply chain realignment, sending prices through the roof as children returned to theater, sports and school.",

COVID-19 canceled most programs and sent unemployment through the roof, while resumed programs and widespread employment in 2021 yielded strong costume and team uniform sales.

Focusing on highly skilled labor comes at a good time, with high interest rates discouraging capital investment but suppressing wages.
