    "executive_summary": "The Oilseed Farming industry produces mainly canola, sunflower and flaxseed, and is small compared with other agriculture sector industries. This causes industry conditions to fluctuate significantly in line with changes in the US agriculture sector based on global and domestic supply conditions. Industry revenue also generally moves in line with changes in the price of oilseeds. Many US farmers can choose to grow other crops, such as corn or soybeans, in any given year depending on expected yields and price, causing drastic fluctuations in the planted acreage and oilseeds harvests. As a result, industry revenue has fluctuated in recent years, largely in line with the price of oilseeds. Overall, industry revenue has grown at an expected CAGR of 6.8% to reach $1.8 billion in 2024, when revenue is set to fall 4.9%. The price of oilseeds has grown at an estimated CAGR of 9.2% leading up to 2024. Growth in the price of oilseeds has been driven by supply chain disruptions stemming from the COVID-19 pandemic, and by Russia's invasion of Ukraine, which has disputed both fuel and oilseed (particularly sunflower) production from both countries. As fuel prices rise, demand for biofuel production increases, supporting growth in industry prices and demand. These same disruptions contributed to higher operating costs, diminishing average industry profit margins. Industry revenue is expected to continue growing only slightly as the price of oilseeds stabilizes and supply chain issues and conflict in Ukraine eventually subsides. Overall, industry revenue is anticipated to increase an a CAGR of 0.6% to $1.9 billion in 2029.",

            "current_performance_point_description": "While not considered part of the Oilseed Farming industry, soybeans are technically considered oilseeds due to their dominance; moreover, their yield is almost twice as much per acre as this industry's crops. Aside from competition from soybeans, oilseed farming is constrained in part by the limited regions that are suitable for production. However, canola can tolerate cooler conditions than soybeans, giving oilseeds a slight advantage."

Imports are dominated by crops from Canada, largely canola crops, since canola grows better in cooler, northern climates. The appreciation of the US dollar in recent years has made imports more competitive. Meanwhile, the United States-Mexico-Canada agreement has eliminated tariffs on oilseeds, allowing for increased trade."

For example, Bulgaria has become a leading source of oilseeds imports for the US as Bulgaria imported a record amount of sunflower from Ukraine following the invasion. The war in Ukraine has contributed to rising global oil prices, as Russian oil has largely left the market. This has driven up demand for biofuels, benefitting the oilseed industry."

While imports are set to decline moving forward, imports are expected to consistently account for more than 40.0% of domestic demand."

            "answer": "According to the report, the key trends impacting costs for the Oilseed Farming industry are:\n\n1. Input costs have grown as seed prices have increased and investors have purchased farmland and raised rent prices.\n\n2. Heightened wage prices have harmed profit for oilseed farmers as input costs also grow. \n\n3. Purchase costs, which consist mainly of fertilizers, pesticides and seeds, have risen as a share of revenue. Specifically:\n    - The cost of fertilizers has decreased over the past five years\n    - Oilseed farming uses a lot of chemicals for pest control, which represent a significant share of purchase costs\n    - Seeds from large agricultural companies that conduct R&D have become more expensive as they produce higher-yield hybrid crops"
