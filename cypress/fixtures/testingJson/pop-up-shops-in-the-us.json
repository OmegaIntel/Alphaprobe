    "executive_summary": "Pop-up shops are becoming increasingly popular among businesses trying to expand brand awareness, test new markets and products, and develop consumer relationships. The 2020 pandemic played a major role in the industry's performance over recent years. Social distancing regulations and growing economic uncertainty have negatively impacted demand for pop-up shops, as consumers lowered discretionary spending. Although economic conditions improved over recent years, revenue gains in 2021 could not mitigate the losses from the remainder of the period. As a result, revenue has declined at an estimated CAGR of 0.7% to $15.6 billion over recent years, including a 1.2% gain in 2024 alone.",

            "current_performance_point_description": "Economic conditions over recent years have negatively impacted pop-up shops' performance. Products sold by pop-up shops are often discretionary in nature, as they are not as easily available as traditional retailers. This trend is less prominent among food vendors. The recovery from the pandemic, supply chain disruptions and high economic uncertainty led to significant inflationary pressure, lowering discretionary spending. Elevated interest rates have made real estate investments less attractive to retailers, incentivizing sellers to opt for pop-up shops. These shops enable retailers to study and test new markets at a lower cost."

Pop-up shops could also operate in outdoor spaces. This prevented the industry from experiencing drastic losses during the pandemic and contributed to a quick recovery. Improving economic conditions during 2021 enabled revenue to jump, surpassing pre-pandemic levels. This is mainly attributed to pent-up demand and consumers becoming more confident."

            "current_performance_point_description": "The rise of online shopping has left brick-and-mortar stores struggling to compete, pushing many retailers to downsize or close operations, leaving storefronts vacant and landlords without rent. This trend has accelerated since the pandemic, concluding that weakness in retail industries will persist after being dealt a significant blow and that pop-up shops are likely to continue operating. Retailers leverage pop-up shops as they are a cost-efficient alternative for retailers to expand operations and reach new markets. Following the pandemic, younger consumers have chosen to splurge on products for themselves, positively impacting the retail sector."

Pop-up shops are often subjected to higher rent prices, as they pay a premium for short-term leases. Rents are likely to determine whether it is cost-effective for any retailer to sign a long- or short-term lease. The Federal Reserve has paused interest rate increases, even hinting at possible interest rate drops over 2024. This, alongside significant commercial real estate vacancies, is likely to result in weakening rent costs, potentially."
