And while some industry participants turned to remote services to mute the mounting losses, telemedicine tools could not fully stem the revenue losses of 2020 that carried into 2021. However, 2022 brought a rebound as wages stabilized and Medicare and Medicaid funding volatility was counterbalanced by an uptick in overall health expenditures and per capita disposable income. Growth continued for the remainder of the period, with industry-wide revenue expected to grow at a CAGR of 0.9% through 2024 and reach $44.7 billion in 2024 when revenue will jump by an estimated 1.1% in 2024 alone.",

                "volatility_description": "Fluctuations in public and private insurance can induce volatility in revenue. Alterations in policies or cutbacks in reimbursement could potentially decrease demand and revenue, but stability in insurance policies and broadened coverage could mitigate it. Audiologists can minimize this impact by diversifying their services, focusing on out-of-pocket clients and advocating for all-inclusive insurance coverage for audiology services."

Audiologists determine if a person is a good candidate for implants. They are also involved with programming the implants and providing any therapy to assist in the adaptation to the implant. Cochlear implants can be expensive where the cost includes the surgery, the purchase cost of the device and rehabilitation following the procedure. Some health insurance plans, including Medicare and Medicaid, may cover cochlear implants."

Audiologists treat vertigo by prescribing medication or using hearing aids or other devices, depending on the condition's cause. Vertigo as a symptom is relatively common, especially among older adults, but is associated with various factors and conditions such as aging, head injuries, migraines, certain medications, or problems in the inner ear or brain."
