As many merchants are also farmers themselves, weather conditions have an effect on industry revenue. If heavy rainfall or lack of rain causes production to drop, limited produce stocks and poor quality may damage sales and raise prices. The sharp changes in price and a relatively small decline in consumption demonstrates that other factors, such as consumers' health consciousness, help keep demand fairly stable, even when prices rise. Due to the low volatility of demand, changes in prices end up bolstering revenue volatility for the industry."
