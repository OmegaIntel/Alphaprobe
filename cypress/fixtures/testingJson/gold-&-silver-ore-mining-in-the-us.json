Revenue is largely a function of mine output and the world prices of gold and silver. Despite an increase in revenue in 2020 amid the breakout of the COVID-19 pandemic heightening demand for precious metals, overall industry revenue has been on the decline due to reduced mine output from resource depletion and lower grades. Industry revenue is projected to have decreased at a CAGR of 0.6% to $11.1 billion over the five years to 2024, with a 2.7% drop in 2024 alone.",

            "question": "Does your company specialize heavily, or do you extract a diversified range of resources?",
            "answer": "Operators primarily mine industry products or mine metals that have produce gold or silver as byproducts. Companies with a more diverse range of products can better withstand price volatility linked to just one commodity."
        },
        {
            "question": "Has your company dealt with volatile input prices over the past few years?",
            "answer": "Input prices of steel slightly affect purchase costs for operators in the industry. Rising oil prices may lead to an increase in purchase costs, contributing to below average profit."

            "question": "How is your company using new technology, such as new drilling techniques?",
            "answer": "Some operators have invested in autonomous machines and processing facilities to reduce labor dependency. Implementing technological advancements, such as drones and new geological surveying methods, can increase efficiency."
        },
        {
            "question": "Have you been able to reduce wage costs by automating operations over the past five years?",
            "answer": "Mining companies are experimenting with the use of autonomous machinery in operations which will help contain the need for employees. Human labor is still essential for the mining sector."
        },
        {
            "question": "Have any regulatory expenses significantly impacted your company's profitability recently?",
            "answer": "The industry encounters a high level of regulation, with oversight from state governments on virtually all aspects of the mining operation."

        {
            "question": "Do you have access to high-quality inputs? How do you contend with fluctuations in input prices?",
            "answer": "Access to large, high-grade reserves is important. A larger deposit generally permits economies of scale and also provides greater flexibility in scheduling output. High-grade reserves are also desirable since their production typically results in lower operating costs."
        },
        {
            "question": "How does your company ensure its production is sufficient to meet demand? Are you able to quickly adjust your operations if needed?",
            "answer": "Successful producers have a capacity to read future trends in demand for industry goods and adjust production accordingly. Amid price rises, companies that have been able to ramp up production amid historic precious metal prices have experienced rising revenue and profit."
        },
        {
            "question": "How do you monitor changing environmental laws? Have you had any compliance issues in the past?",
            "answer": "Companies must be able to meet environmental laws and regulations to successfully develop and operate mines. Even after resources are depleted, companies are responsible for land reclamation and may even be found responsible to pay for cleanup if an environmental hazard exists. Industry players that are recognized for safety and reclamation often have more successful operations and are more likely to avoid costly expenses which had previously been overlooked."
