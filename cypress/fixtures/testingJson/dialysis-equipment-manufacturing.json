Due to growing demand for dialysis treatment, revenue for the Dialysis Equipment Manufacturing industry increased over the five years to 2021. The aging US population has increased the number of individuals with kidney diseases in recent years; according to the US Renal Data System (USRDS), the incidence of end-stage renal disease has increased at an annualized rate of 1.1% over the five years to 2018 (latest data available). Additionally, in 2020, downstream demand increased during the COVID-19 (coronavirus) pandemic. Consequently, demand for dialysis treatment has grown, fueling growth for downstream kidney dialysis centers. IBISWorld expects industry revenue to increase at an annualized rate of 5.4% to $3.0 billion over the five years to 2021.",
