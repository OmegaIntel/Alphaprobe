    "executive_summary": "Figures have been adjusted for inflation and are presented in 2024 currency. The 3D printer manufacturing industry has seen significant advancements and cost reductions, making the technology more accessible to a broader audience. Once prohibitively expensive, commercial 3D printers are now available at a range of prices based on capacity and supported materials. Desktop 3D printers have also become more affordable, bringing the technology within reach of hobbyists and small businesses. Enhanced capabilities like multi-material printing, higher printing resolution and larger build volumes have diversified applications, attracting industries such as aerospace, automotive and healthcare. Additionally, more user-friendly software interfaces and plug-and-play setups have further lowered adoption barriers.",
