    "executive_summary": "Culinary arts schools faced economic headwinds leading up to the COVID-19 pandemic, bringing on declining revenue. Revenue continued sinking as social-distancing regulations discouraged enrollment, but, as the pandemic subsided and vaccination rates rose, culinary arts schools saw a sudden surge in enrollment as students that previously deferred their education began attending classes. Strong government stimulus boosted students' spending capacity, making postsecondary education more affordable for them and lifting the number of enrollments for culinary arts schools. Inflation in more recent years has slowed growth, though. Still, this post-pandemic surge has more than made up for the declines in the previous years, and revenue has climbed at a CAGR of 6.7% to an estimated $33.5 billion over the five years through 2024, including an expected rise of 3.3% in 2024 alone.",

With less to spend, demand from consumers for education in the culinary arts has waned.
