    "executive_summary": "Figures have been adjusted for inflation and are presented in 2022 currency.\n\nThe Ice Making Machine Manufacturing industry experienced subdued growth over the five years to 2022. Healthcare, hospitality and food-service providers are the industry's primary markets, and were all heavily affected by COVID-19 (coronavirus). Healthcare providers are the industry's largest downstream market, since hospitals use an exorbitant amount of ice per patient each day. Despite strong demand from hospitals, declines in restaurants and businesses in the hospitality industry due to the coronavirus pandemic have dragged down industry performance for the current period overall. Additionally, import penetration has resulted in intermittent revenue declines during the period. Therefore, over the five years to 2022, industry revenue is estimated to increase an annualized of 0.5% to $963.7 million.\n\nUnderlying industry demand has been sustained by growth in the accommodations and food services sector. As the US economy grew during the first half of the current five-year period and employment and disposable incomes rose, consumers began to spend more on traveling and dining out. Increased demand and sales at hotels, restaurants and other food-service providers justified the need for capital spending on durable machinery, such as ice making machines. However, as mentioned, this was largely undone by the coronavirus in in 2020, with industry revenue declining an estimated 9.2% in 2020 alone. The recovery of demand from the sector since 2021 has returned the industry to growth, with industry revenue projected to rise 1.4% during the current year.",

            "current_performance_point_description": "The food-service sector is one of the primary markets for this industry because ice making machines are needed to preserve meat, fish and dairy in supermarkets and cool drinks and alcoholic beverages in bars, restaurants and other food establishments. According to Foodservice Equipment Reports Magazine, an average restaurant will use 1.5 pounds of ice for each meal sold, while keeping a salad bar chilled requires 35 pounds of ice per cubic foot. Hotels and the hospitality sector are other major downstream markets for industry operators because these establishments commonly provide their guests with ice."

            "current_performance_point_description": "Revenue in the food-service and hospitality markets increased over the past five years, as employment and disposable income levels grew and consumer discretionary spending on eating out and traveling increased. However, the fallout from the coronavirus pandemic introduced tremendous volatility for the industry, which led to steep declines in 2020 and dragged down performance for the current period. However, the recovery of the sector and positive trends predating the pandemic have buoyed industry revenue. For example, demand from food-service and drinking places is expected to rise an annualized 0.5% over the five years to 2022."

According to IBISWorld estimates, hospitals are a major market for industry operators, accounting for an estimated 39.2% of total industry sales. Major players, such as Welbilt Inc., produce and promote products tailored for healthcare use; its RN Series machines make soft, easy-to-chew nugget ice for hospital patients. An aging US population and rising enrollment in public and private health insurance boosted revenue in the hospital and healthcare sector."

Supermarkets and grocery stores are anticipated to steadily expand due to population growth rates, leading to stable demand for ice making machines. Moreover, food-service and accommodation providers are projected to experience strong growth as consumer income rises and these downstream markets experience pent-up demand following challenges stemming from the pandemic between 2020 and 2022. Over the five years to 2027, demand from food-service and drinking places is projected to grow an annualized 2.6%, while demand from accommodations is forecast to increase at an annualized rate of 4.5%."

However, import competition will be limited by the depreciation in the value of the US dollar. This depreciation is reflected in an annualized decline of 1.2% in the trade-weighted index over the five years to 2027, which indicates that the US dollar will decline compared with the currencies of major trading partners. Nevertheless, over the five years to 2027, imports are projected to increase at an annualized rate of 5.1% to $431.8 million."
