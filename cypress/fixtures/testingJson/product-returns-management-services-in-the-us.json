    "executive_summary": "Returns processing, also known as reverse logistics, is a crucial aspect of any business that sells physical products. When items are damaged in shipping, covered under warranty, included in a recall, or don't fit the customer, returns processors step in to squeeze out as much value as possible. Returns processors handle all aspects of this process, from receiving returned items, verifying product defects, and sorting items based on condition. These analyses provide insight to help returns processors price or repair each item before moving them out to recommerce, liquidation, or disposal providers. A pain-free returns process with maximum value is critical for businesses as it retains customer loyalty.",
