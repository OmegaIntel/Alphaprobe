    "executive_summary": "Over the past five years, the performance of the Plastic Pipe and Parts Manufacturing industry mirrored the volatile economic conditions in the United States. This industry offers a wide range of plastic pipes and profiling shapes like tubes, rods and car components. Plastic pipes, especially polyvinyl chloride (PVC) pipes, are used to construct new homes, while other plastic profile shapes, like plastic rods and tubes, are used in automobile production. New changes in the manufacturing of plastic pipes have enabled them to handle higher pressures and temperatures, expanding their use in industrial manufacturing, oil and gas and pressurized water supply applications.",

            "question": "Are your company's sales heavily dependent on the health of the US economy?",
            "answer": "Demand for industry products is heavily linked with activity in the construction and industrial manufacturing markets. When the US economy is growing, these markets typically increase production, which in turn leads to increased demand for industry products. Amidst an increasingly hawkish Federal Reserve, demand for industry products have stagnated recently due to higher borrowing costs for the industry's industrial and nonresidential market segments. Residential housing markets, however, have so far been resistant to large-scale declines despite the interest rate increases; uncertainty does exist within this market down the road, though."

            "question": "Has your company been exposed to volatile input prices over the past few years?",
            "answer": "Manufacturers are directly affected by the price of plastic materials and resin. The price of plastic materials and resin has increased in recent years as highly volatile crude oil prices coupled with supply chain issues created a wave of volatility within the larger domestic market. Manufacturers are unable to pass off highly increased costs to customers, affecting profitability."

            "question": "Supply contracts",
            "answer": "A reliable supply of key inputs, like resin, at a competitive cost, increases the company's profitability. A supply contract fixes the price of the company's inputs, allowing it to be more price-competitive. With recent supply chain issues globally, it's important for the supply contracts to be able to avoid the current inflated prices and secure a solid price point in order to avoid eating into profitability."
