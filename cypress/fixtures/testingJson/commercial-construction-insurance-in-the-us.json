The industry is an indispensable part of risk management in commercial construction. Most commercial construction premiums are obtained through renewing policies relating to existing risks. Many construction companies view policies as inelastic, although some may choose to decrease consumption of insurance policies should premium prices climb. Over the past five years, revenue has grown at a CAGR of 2.3% to $50.3 billion, including and expected jump of 5.2% in 2024. Profit is expected to climb to 14.1% of revenue in 2024 from 13.3% in 2019.",

As more commercial construction projects begin, the need for more insurance coverage, ranging from workers' compensation to professional liability insurance provided by operators in this industry will also increase. However, with more construction projects beginning during the period, there can also be an expected increase in the number of policy filing claims, which will slightly stymie industry profitability."
