    "executive_summary": "The Pet Photography industry, which includes portrait, commercial and still photography services, has fallen over the five years to 2023 amid contentious economic conditions and competition from smartphone cameras. The industry has responded to shifting consumer preferences by increasing the number of nonemployer professionals who can offer industry services at a lower rate than large, established companies. Growth in per capita disposable income and total advertising expenditure have partially offset declines in the pet photography industry. However, the COVID-19 pandemic precipitated a massive decline in revenue in 2020 as pet photographers and their subjects were often prohibited from gathering together. Consequently, the industry has yet to achieve pre-pandemic levels of income. Revenue is anticipated to fall at a CAGR of 3.2% to $140.5 million over the five years to 2024, including a 1.4% decrease in 2024 alone.",

The gap between traditional digital cameras and comprehensive, lightweight smartphone counterparts will continue to close significantly in quality, accessibility, and convenience. Phone cameras can be easily charged, photos can be transferred back to the cloud and basic editing systems can even be run. As a result of increased smartphone usage, pet photographer services have been demanded less since customers can take photos of their pets themselves."
