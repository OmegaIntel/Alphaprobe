    "executive_summary": "Figures have been adjusted for inflation and are presented in 2024 currency. Paint and sip studios offer painting classes and serve wine and other alcoholic beverages. Unlike traditional fine arts classes, paint and sip studios focus on providing a recreational and leisure experience for their customers. These studios have benefited from the growing demand for social activities. Many participate in paint and sip studios with their friends or colleagues. Many corporations have included paint and sip studios as one of the after-work activities for their employees. However, the industry suffered from the social distancing amid COVID-19. As a result, industry revenue fell an annualized 0.2% to $148.0 million over the five years to 2024, including a 1.3% decline in 2024 alone.",

Paint and sip studios have emerged as a new form of recreational and educational classes in which customers can enjoy time with their companions while gaining some art skills. Customers are provided with all the supplies, and they can take their artwork home as a souvenir. Some studios even let customers bring their drinks. The relaxed and fun environment at industry establishments is expected to be the key selling point for paint and sip studios over the coming years."
