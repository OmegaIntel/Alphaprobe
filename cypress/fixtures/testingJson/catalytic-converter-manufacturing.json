    "executive_summary": "Figures have been adjusted for inflation and are presented in 2021 currency. The Catalytic Converter Manufacturing industry produces devices containing a catalyst for converting pollutant gases in vehicle exhaust systems; therefore, demand for industry products is closely tied to demand for automobiles as well as to regulatory standards. More stringent emissions standards and increasing demand for replacement and aftermarket catalytic converters helped sustain demand over the past five years. However, the industry experienced significant headwinds during the COVID-19 (coronavirus) pandemic, as a global decline in demand caused oil prices to contract and stay at home orders in the United States resulted in most consumers remaining homebound. Nevertheless, industry revenue is expected to increase at an annualized rate of 1.9% reaching $8.0 billion in 2021, including projected growth of 7.1% in 2021 as it rebounds from a two-year slump.",
