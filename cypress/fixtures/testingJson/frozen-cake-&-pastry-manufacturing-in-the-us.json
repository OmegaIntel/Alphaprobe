    "executive_summary": "Figures have been adjusted for inflation and are presented in 2024 currency.\n\nFrozen cake and pastry manufacturers endured challenging conditions over the five years to 2024. Swelling health consciousness, changing consumer tastes and competition from fresh bakery items have hampered demand for traditional frozen cake and pastry products. In response to these trends, frozen cake and pastry manufacturers have focused on reformulating existing dessert selections with healthier, higher-quality ingredients. Frozen cake and pastry manufacturers also experimented with new flavor combinations while launching single-serving varieties that appeal to a wider range of health-conscious consumers. Despite major efforts to revitalize the frozen baked desserts market, frozen cake and pastry manufacturers have continued to contend with tepid demand from consumers and intensifying competition from other industries. That's why industry revenue will only inch up at a CAGR of 0.1% to an estimated $7.5 billion over the past five years, including a projected boost of 0.6% in 2024. The prices of key inputs like wheat, flour and milk have strengthened over the past five years, pushing up purchase costs for most frozen cake and pastry manufacturers and preventing profit expansion. Overall, average profit is expected to be 1.2% in 2024.",
