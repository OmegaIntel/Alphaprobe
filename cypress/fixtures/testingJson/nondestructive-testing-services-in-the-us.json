    "executive_summary": "Nondestructive testing service companies have benefited from rapidly changing technology and the increasing complexity of products and processes that need testing over the past few years, although revenue has been volatile during the current period. Companies experienced severe losses during 2020 as COVID-19 rocked the US economy, with profit becoming negative. The industry benefited from soaring corporate profit resulting from surging GDP growth amid the pandemic recovery, but the lapse of COVID-19-era aid reduced investment in public utilities, constraining demand from a major market for providers. As a result, revenue didn't rise much in 2021 and 2022. Over the past few years, skyrocketing interest rates have made it much more expensive for businesses to set up facilities and purchase equipment, causing them to reduce spending on NDT services.",

The two dominant technologies in the field of nondestructive testing (NDT), ultrasonic and radiographic testing, have both experienced a slew of technological changes. Specifically, phased array ultrasonic testing uses multiple elements in an array within a transducer to steer, focus and scan ultrasonic beams electronically. This enables providers to get an extremely detailed and accurate assessment of the internal structure of materials."

In response, major players in this moderately concentrated industry ramped up the pace of mergers and acquisitions to maintain whatever net income they had left. These tactics are also meant to protect the presence of the biggest companies in this industry and capitalize on the success of smaller competitors."

Despite these positive developments, the industry was negatively affected by slow demand from the utilities sector. Public investment in electricity systems, power plants, trash and recycling systems and other forms of necessary utilities infrastructure declined in 2021 and 2022 as the lapse of pandemic-era deficit spending made it difficult for authorities to start or do existing work on various projects."

Quite a few businesses have halted their investment in new facilities and equipment since they can't afford to borrow money anymore. New materials require NDT in many instances, so higher interest rates have hindered downstream demand for the industry's services, fostering an expected decline in revenue in 2024."
