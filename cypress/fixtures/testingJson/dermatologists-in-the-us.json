    "executive_summary": "Rising incomes and broader insurance coverage have facilitated access to dermatology practices in recent years, supporting robust practice growth. While COVID-19 disrupted growth as patient volumes fell in 2020, a jump in healthcare spending and pent-up demand post-COVID offset the drop. Still, the pandemic has had more lasting effects on dermatology practices. COVID-19 has caused more practices to adopt teledermatology, while rising operating costs have accelerated consolidation activity. Revenue has been expanding at a CAGR of 1.0% to an expected $8.7 billion over the past five years. A slowdown in total healthcare spending and recession concerns will slow growth to an estimated 0.5% in 2023.",

Private equity firms invest in dermatology groups, often acquiring smaller, physician-owned practices. PE interest in dermatology has accelerated as a result of rising."
