    "executive_summary": "Electrical equipment manufacturers have endured moderate volatility in recent years. During the initial stages of the pandemic, changes in demand from the industrial sector, one of the largest downstream users of electrical equipment, negatively impacted equipment manufacturers. Significant supply chain disruptions, social distancing requirements and weaker demand for manufactured products led to revenue losses, a trend enhanced by instability in the nonresidential construction sector. However, the ongoing economic recovery has enabled demand for manufactured goods to bounce back, while historically high corporate profit has boosted demand for construction projects. As a result, revenue has grown at an estimated CAGR of 2.7% to $57.1 billion through the current period, including a 0.4% gain in 2024 alone.",
