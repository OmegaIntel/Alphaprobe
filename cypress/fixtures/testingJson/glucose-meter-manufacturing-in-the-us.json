    "executive_summary": "Over the past five years, the glucose meter manufacturing industry has benefited from the rising prevalence of diabetes. The American Diabetes Association (ADA) reports that there are about 8.5 million individuals with undiagnosed diabetes, providing manufacturers with a large potential customer base. Diabetic patients use glucose meters to manage their glucose levels, as these meters measure and display the amount of sugar (i.e., glucose) in their blood. Products have increasingly appealed to diabetic patients because meters now require less blood to take measurements and can store previous glucose levels, streamlining patients' healthcare data. However, over the past five years, revenue has slumped at a CAGR of 0.9% to $3.1 billion, including an expected 1.4% increase in 2023. Profit is expected to slump to 7.9% of revenue in 2023 from 10.8% in 2018.",
