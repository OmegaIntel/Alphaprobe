    "executive_summary": "According to The Vision Council (a non-profit trade association), 75.6% of adults in the US use some form of vision correction, and 63.7% of adults wear prescription eyeglasses. Eye surgery clinics have targeted the large vision correction market, achieving growth driven by demographic and technological change. Increased screen time and a healthcare system focusing on preventive care have fostered demand and potential clients. Rising eye disease rates and an aging population have also spurred demand. However, the costs of alternatives like glasses and contact lenses, combined with millennials' smaller budgets, dampen the number of surgeries. Younger adults, especially those aged 20-40, may opt not to pay for expensive vision correction surgery despite their potential benefits.",
