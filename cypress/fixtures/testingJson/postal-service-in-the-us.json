    "executive_summary": "Figures have been adjusted for inflation and are presented in 2024 currency.\n\nPostal service in the United States includes establishments that are part of the national postal service. The USPS, a major player in this industry, has been implementing reforms lately in response to dwindling performances, like cutting costs and pushing for higher prices. However, the effects of these reforms have been largely unsuccessful as they have still lost profit in this period. The agency, independent but under the guidance of the Postal Regulatory Commission, has also been preventing it from making more reforms, shaping how it performs in the period.\n\nAs online ways of distributing information have grown in popularity, traditional mail has become less popular, hurting this industry's performance. Private mail carriers have been a significant factor negatively impacting this industry because of their ability to offer identical types of services through savvier means and prices. Factors like the popularization of online media have also been hurting the USPS, as more people are using the internet, impacting how much physical mailing people need. Because of these factors, revenue for the postal service has been falling at a CAGR of 1.4% over the past five years and is expected to reach $79.7 billion in 2024. Revenue will drop 1.6% in that year.",

Consumers still need a service to deliver their mail and packages. Despite the massive shifts in the market, the USPS remained afloat. However, with rival industries offering delivery services at competitive rates, it has been a struggle for the USPS to compete with the size and scope of companies like UPS and FedEx, making the postal service a less competitive industry.

            "answer": "Large healthcare and retirement costs have led to large losses rather than operational costs such as fuel. For more than a decade, the USPS has struggled to mitigate the costs of its retirement and healthcare accounts to ensure gains, but to little avail."

USPS must successfully increase delivery rates to make up for lower mail volume, so the USPS has little control over passing along cost increases."

            "question": "How has the spike in e-commerce sales during COVID-19 affected your business? Do you rely on e-commerce sales to generate revenue?",
