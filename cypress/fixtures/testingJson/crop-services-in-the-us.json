    "executive_summary": "Crop service companies assist in a variety of support services that make them integral to businesses throughout the agriculture sector. Performance is the aggregate result of many different types of services. Despite slow growth in the industry's largest market segment, fruit and vegetable farming, revenue has grown at a CAGR of 7.9% through the end of 2024, reaching an estimated $40.7 billion. Grains like corn and wheat and oilseed crops like soybeans have become more significant in providing for a rising global population. Corn production, which requires services such as crop dusting, has become essential. US renewable energy quotas have pushed for the crop's use in ethanol production, increasing revenue generated from this segment. In 2020, normal operations were disrupted by the outbreak of COVID-19.

            "current_performance_point_description": "In 2018, China placed tariffs on several US crops, limiting demand and crop prices. Decreased revenue for crop producers slowed industry growth slightly, but it continued through 2023. Demand from downstream industries was disrupted again in 2020 by the COVID-19 pandemic. Many farms that faced a surplus still needed to use agricultural services to maintain their crops and prevent major production declines in the long term. Crop service providers often help farms deal with volatility and uncertainty, so as the Agriculture sector has faced higher volatility, crop service companies have benefited. So long as farms remain in business, there will always be demand for crop service providers."

Farms have struggled to hire staff to meet production needs because farming activities are highly seasonal, resulting in labor shortages at crucial times. Outsourcing work to crop service providers enables farmers to eliminate the problem by finding trained workers at reasonable prices when they need them. Contracting companies retain these workers year-long and apply them to different farms and crops at different stages of the farming process."

However, farm labor has become less appealing to non-US nationals in recent years. Several states have implemented strict anti-immigrant policies, making finding and keeping a job harder. The majority of immigrants in farm labor come from Mexico, but immigration has stalled in recent years as the country's manufacturing sector has boomed, providing competitive wages. The industry's labor-intensive services have declined as a share of revenue. Meanwhile, crop service providers have increased average wages to help retain workers."

New organic growers need specialty inputs, access to uncontaminated equipment and technical assistance from experts familiar with organic growing techniques. Organic production is typically more costly than non-organic crop growing. Organic growing has a higher labor intensity without pesticides and herbicides because farms need staff to employ non-chemical pest prevention techniques."

As the number of acres dedicated to high-yield crops increases, farmers will seek more help planting and harvesting. Genetically modified crops and seeds will be used more widely, resulting in higher yields and leading to a greater need for outsourced assistance. Crop prices set by farmers are expected to increase due to farmers consolidating and gaining greater bargaining power. This trend will likely result in farms being resistant to price increases from industry operators."

The two biggest services, soil preparation and postharvest activities, are labor-intensive. Foreign-born workers, mostly from Mexico, comprise a significant portion of this labor. The Mexican agriculture sector has had strong growth in recent years. Jobs in Mexico have been able to increase wages, forcing US producers to compete. Immigration policy may also cause issues within the industry; current legislation deters many agricultural workers or leads them to work on farms illegally."

This will encourage greater capital investment in new technologies to improve service efficiencies. Automating some of the labor-intensive services will help decrease labor costs. However, revenue will be derived more from capital-intensive services such as cotton ginning rather than from labor-intensive services such as fruit harvesting. Cotton growing has come under attack in recent years for its effects on the environment and for its demands on water resources. These concerns are gaining more attention from policymakers thanks to pressure from lobby groups."

As farms look to reduce costs and stay ahead of competitors, farm support services that offer the latest technology will have an advantage. Crop service companies can use artificial intelligence to automate irrigation systems, manage crop rotation, predict crop yields and perform other crop support services.

            "answer": "Prices received for that area's crops can swing wildly based on a variety of factors, including weather conditions, global agricultural production and demand from domestic and foreign food manufacturers. So growth in the agricultural price index increases demand for industry services."

Therefore, rising interest rates, represented by the prime rate as a proxy, will encourage crop farmers to use more of the industry's support services."
