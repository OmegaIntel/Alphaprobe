Another market that manufacturers decided to target is male cosmetics. Cosmetics formulated for men have packaging and scents that appeal to a male audience. Men's inexperience with beauty stores results in most of these sales taking place online. Younger consumers are becoming increasingly aware of consumerism's impact on the environment, increasing demand for naturally derived and eco-friendly personal products. This has pushed retailers to shift their product offerings. Foreign cosmetic brands are becoming increasingly popular among domestic consumers. As consumers have become increasingly curious about foreign brands, particularly Asian beauty products, retailers have kept them in stock to adapt to changing consumer preferences."
