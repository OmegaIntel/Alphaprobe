            "question": "Does your company specialize in one corner of the market or produce a diversified range of products?",
            "answer": "Sparkling waters have become extremely popular, providing growth opportunities for operators in this space. Enhanced water brands like Propel and VitaminWater have increased revenue for their parent companies while also supporting profitability."
        },
        {
            "question": "Are your company's sales heavily dependent on the health of the US economy?",
            "answer": "Sales of bottled water, sparkling water and premade ice typically rise as individuals feel confident in the economy and have a greater level of disposable income to spend on discretionary purchases. When the health of the economy declines, consumers traditionally spend less on industry goods and instead turn to tap water to save money."
        },
        {
            "question": "How has your company lessened its exposure to potentially volatile input prices? How are you hedging against higher prices going forward?",
            "answer": "Volatility prices of plastic materials and resin can pressure profitability. One of the ways how a company can hedge against higher prices is by investing in alternative forms of plastic that are cheaper, environmentally friendly and work with the US Food and Drug Administration to set business-friendly regulatory standards for the industry."
        },
        {
            "question": "Has your company explored acquisition opportunities in locations with well-established infrastructure networks?",
            "answer": "Joining forces with a larger operator will boost efficiencies in production and distribution. Optimal shelf space in retail locations is significant. A merger with a company with retail contracts would be a huge advantage."
        },
        {
            "question": "How has your company addressed the growing awareness of plastic's harmful effects on the environment?",
            "answer": "Environmental concerns leads bottled water producers to invest in recyclable materials. The trend toward sustainability has encouraged companies to design bottles and packaging that uses less plastic and also comes partly from recycled plastic material. More companies have sought to differentiate themselves from competitors by making environmental awareness a core competency of their business."
        },
        {
            "question": "Does your company use SAP software systems to optimize all aspects of manufacturing, sales, inventory and distribution channels?",
            "answer": "Tracking sales allows companies to optimize production levels to reduce waste and identify synergies. Bottled water and ice are bulky and heavy; therefore, distribution costs are high. Locking in contracts with distribution networks may provide lower rates."
        },
        {
            "question": "Have you had any regulatory expenses that have significantly impacted profitability?",
            "answer": "EPA regulations are constantly updated and operators need to monitor and adapt to the changes. The FDA sets specific standards for different types of bottled water by outlining the maximum allowable mineral and microbiological levels within each product class."
        },
        {
            "question": "Is your company adequately prepared to adjust to changing environmental standards?",
            "answer": "Bottled water and ice must meet the purity and safety requirements for public drinking water established by the EPA. Ice manufacturing facilities use refrigerants like ammonia and Freon for cold storage; the EPA requires the safe disposable of those chemicals."
        },
        {
            "question": "What percentage of your company's customers renew their contracts?",
            "answer": "Brand loyalty is important in bottled water. Some consumers continue to purchase preferred brands despite price hikes. Many bottled water producers like industry producer Primo Water Corporation benefit from contracts supplying water jugs to offices."
        },
        {
            "question": "What challenges does your company experience regarding financing its ongoing operations?",
            "answer": "Staying current with food safety and sustainable water sourcing and packaging materials increases costs for bottled water and ice manufacturers. A company has to monitor developments in the global economy as any rapid fluctuations in the prices of services like shipping container costs can either help or harm industry profit."
        },
        {
            "question": "Does your company have a strong brand name? If not, how can you improve your reputation? How are you currently establishing your brand?",
            "answer": "Consumers typically purchase water from a narrow range of trusted brands. Ensuring that a company's brand is part of this small group is vital to winning purchases and outperforming competitors. A company could establish its brand by investing more capital to tackle environmental issues while improving product efficiency, improving its profit margin and appealing to environmentally-conscious consumers."
        },
        {
            "question": "What is your budget for expanding operations? How do you ensure you have cost-effective distribution methods?",
            "answer": "Strong distribution networks allow bottlers to gain retailer shelf space and reach the maximum number of customers. Good distribution channels are also needed to minimize supply chain costs. By upgrading domestic production facilities with the latest technology, a company would improve efficiency within the production process and standardize its supply chain."
        },
        {
            "question": "How do you balance price rates to stimulate demand? Who is your biggest competition based on pricing?",
            "answer": "Bottled water is a low-margin business, so slight price differences can lead to significantly higher profit. However, higher prices may also lead consumers to switch to lower-cost alternatives. Businesses must strike the correct balance to maximize revenue and profit. Internally, a company has to price its products in a way that doesn't eat into its profit while maintaining a competitive price with its competitors."
        },
        {
            "question": "Do you monitor per capita soft drink consumption? What new products compete strongest with your company's offerings?",
            "answer": "Rising health-consciousness among consumers will likely encourage the switch from soda to water. Some of the biggest competitors for the industry include drinks with nutritional additives and tea, both of which serve as strong substitutes for soft drinks and complement the benefits of bottled water."
        },
        {
            "question": "Do you monitor the healthy eating index? When US diets are healthier, does your company benefit or struggle?",
            "answer": "Since water does not contain sugar, caffeine, calories or other additives commonly found in other beverages, many health-conscious consumers are substituting soft drinks for bottled water. For a company to succeed, it must stay on top of the most recent health trends domestically, with healthier diets a sign that consumers may be interested in pushing towards healthier drinks for their bodies."
        },
        {
            "question": "How have fluctuations in per capita disposable income affected your company?",
