    "executive_summary": "The Adult Diaper Manufacturing industry is made up of companies that produce diapers, pads and other incontinence supplies for adults. These products are primarily used by seniors and people with disabilities that have medical conditions that cause incontinence. For people with incontinence, adult diapers are a necessity, so the industry benefits from relatively inelastic demand. This has enabled the industry to maintain steady profit over the five years to 2022. However, industry revenue can be affected by operating costs, demographic changes, and competition from foreign manufacturers. Over the past five years, the industry has struggled slightly in the face of rising imports and supply chain disruptions brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic. As a result, over the five years to 2022, industry revenue is expected to decline at an annualized rate of 0.8% to $4.4 billion. However, as the economy begins to stabilize following the pandemic, industry revenue is anticipated to increase an estimated 1.3% in 2022.",
