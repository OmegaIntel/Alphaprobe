A surging residential housing market during 2020 and 2021 is expected to uplift the demand for industry services."
        },
        {
            "question": "Does your company focus on one specific forest support service, or do you provide a range of services?",
            "answer": "Most operators in this industry are localized with only one person working at the company, as such they generally only provide one service."
        },
        {
            "question": "How frequently are you impacted by adverse weather in the region, and how do you manage that risk?",
            "answer": "Adverse weather conditions, especially forest fires provide increased demand for operators in this industry. Most importantly with the rise incidence of natural disasters as climate conditions deteriorate, it is likely that sensitivity to adverse weather will increase in the future."
        },
        {
            "question": "How do you deal with changes in market prices for your inputs?",
            "answer": "Operators generally try to pass on costs when prices increase, garnering higher revenue but lower profits. When prices fall, the opposite occurs. Furthermore, industry operators may enter into long-term service contracts with downstream customers, protecting themselves from downside risk. However, amid a surge in demand, they could have prevented themselves from incurring larger growth."
        },
        {
            "question": "How do you use technology, compared to your competitors?",
            "answer": "As this industry is highly fragmented, operators use a wide range of technological devices to perform industry services, such as drones."
        },
        {
            "question": "Where can you increase your company's level of automation?",
            "answer": "As most operators in this industry are small with no more than one additional employee, the need for automation is low. Drones can increase labor productivity allowing the employee to cover more ground."
        },
        {
            "question": "What agencies are your primary regulators? Have you had any compliance issues in the past?",
            "answer": "Operators in this industry are regulated by various federal regulators due to the highly fragmented nature of the industry. Two major federal regulators include the Forest Service and the Bureau of Land Management. The current administration's heightened regulation of the environment and labor safety are likely to increase operating costs."
        },
        {
            "question": "Do you receive any federal subsidies? How much do they contribute to your revenue?",
            "answer": "Most operators do not receive federal subsidies, but the increasingly outsourced firefighting services both from private insurers and the government have increased demand for these services for operators."
        },
        {
            "question": "How does your company address seasonal fluctuations in workload?",
            "answer": "Depending on the service provided, certain companies only operate during certain periods in the year. Larger companies diversify services that they can focus on during different parts of the year."
        },
        {
            "question": "How profitable is your company, compared with your competitors?",
            "answer": "Due to the highly fragmented nature of the industry, profitability ranges based upon the services provided by operators in this industry. By diversifying operations, companies can protect themselves from heightened volatility as well as market risk."
        },
        {
            "question": "What incentives do you have in place to maintain a highly skilled workforce? What qualifications must your employees have?",
            "answer": "Many of the tasks carried out by this industry require highly trained personnel (e.g. remote sensing, timber valuation, consulting and forestry research.)"
        },
        {
            "question": "How do you ensure the appropriate conditions for growth and harvesting? How do you prepare for uncertain weather conditions?",
            "answer": "The biophysical conditions of the timber species chosen for growth and harvesting affect operators' ability to gain additional work."
        },
        {
            "question": "Do you currently have contacts within key markets? How do you stay ahead of the competition?",
            "answer": "It is imperative to establish sales through contacts within downstream forestry sectors, given the high level of competition in this industry."
        },
        {
            "question": "How do lumber prices affect your business?",
            "answer": "This industry provides support services to industries that eventually sell sawmill lumber. When timber prices are high downstream operators can better afford industry services. As a result, skyrocketing lumber prices have aided downstream operations."
        },
        {
            "question": "How will you pass increased costs down to customers?",
            "answer": "Operators generally try to pass on costs when prices increase, garnering higher revenue but lower profits."
        },
        {
            "question": "How much of your revenue is spent on fuel?",
            "answer": "Fuel represents a significant cost for forest support service companies that monitor significant tracts of timberland by ground transportation. Fuel price volatility can have the propensity to ruin margins."
        },
        {
            "question": "How will you take advantage of an increase in government consumption and investment? How much of your revenue comes from government entities?",
            "answer": "Government consumption and investment heavily relies on the firefighting and pest control segments. More importantly, some of the largest timber tracts in the nation are federally owned and therefore represent a significant opportunity for industry operators."
