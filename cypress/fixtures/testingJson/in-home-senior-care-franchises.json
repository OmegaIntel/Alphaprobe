    "executive_summary": "The In-Home Senior Care Franchises industry is benefiting from a growing number of aging baby boomers. Over the five years to 2022, the number of adults aged 65 and older is expected to grow an annualized 2.9% to 56.9 million people. As people live longer due to advancements in medicine and technology, a growing number of seniors are looking to stay in their own homes and maintain independence for as long as possible. Additionally, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA) includes changes to nursing services for seniors and the disabled, among them encouraging the transition from nursing home services to at-home managed care. As a result, industry revenue is expected to grow at an annualized rate of 9.1% to $19.1 billion over the five years to 2022, including growth of 4.0% in 2022. Demand for industry services was accelerated by the COVID-19 (coronavirus) pandemic, as fear of exposure to the coronavirus caused many seniors and family members to reconsider stays at senior living facilities. The emergence of telehealth and other virtual technologies enabled this shift.",
