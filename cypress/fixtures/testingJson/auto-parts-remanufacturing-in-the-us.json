    "executive_summary": "Auto parts remanufacturers have endured volatile conditions through the current period. Demand for remanufactured parts runs countercyclical to the economy; buyers often trade up to new parts and replace vehicles when the economy improves. Despite this trend, remanufacturers struggled amid the pandemic. Although economic conditions plummeted, stay-at-home orders discouraged driving activity, limiting demand for replacement parts. Conversely, revenue surged as local, state and federal governments lifted lockdowns, contributing to torrid pent-up demand for driving and travel. This trend added to strong demand for remanufactured parts, especially amid lingering economic uncertainty. Regardless, companies have been unable to recover to pre-pandemic levels. Overall, revenue waned at an expected CAGR of 2.1% through the current period, including a 0.4% drop in 2024, where profit settled at 5.1%. Remanufacturers faced major supply chain uncertainty following the pandemic and the Russian invasion of Ukraine, contributing to volatile profit. Climbing metal and electronic component costs forced many remanufacturers to absorb higher costs, though leading remanufacturers were able to leverage strong reputations and supply chain connections to mitigate input volatility. Companies have also invested in new technology to reduce long-term costs, leading to elevated capital expenses. Many remanufacturers have also invested in automation, diagnostic systems and supply chain management systems to gain a competitive edge and salvage profit. Improving economic conditions will pressure auto parts remanufacturers through the outlook period. Improving consumer confidence, disposable income and corporate profit will encourage buyers to trade up to new parts or replace vehicles altogether. Upstream innovation will also alter the industry's outlook. New vehicles have longer lifespans, diminishing demand for repairs and remanufactured parts, even as the average vehicle age in the US climbs. Similarly, electric and hybrid vehicles have different components than internal combustion engine vehicles, forcing remanufacturers to adapt new technologies and manufacturing processes. However, some remanufacturers may lean on evolving and expanding demand for classic and vintage cars, supplying second-hand parts for hobbyists and collectors. Overall, revenue will rebound at an expected CAGR of 0.5% through the outlook period, where profit will reach 5.1%.",

In particular, increasing total vehicle miles and motor vehicle registrations highlighted pent-up demand. Swelling driving activity, coupled with lingering economic uncertainty and climbing interest rates encouraged consumers to seek repairs and used vehicles rather than new cars, supporting demand for remanufactured parts."
