    "executive_summary": "Autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) manufacturers serve several markets, with the most notable being the US government, more specifically, the Department of Defense (DoD). The DoD is an essential downstream client for AUV manufacturers since they provide manufacturers with stability through contracts. The other two clients are research and oil and gas companies, which use AUVs for more commercial applications. During the period, AUV manufacturers have experienced strong demand from all downstream clients, but government contracts and oil and gas companies stood out the most.",

            "current_performance_point_description": "In early 2022, the Federal Reserve announced that it would be increasing interest rates across the US economy to try and dial in the rampant, persistent inflation. Increasing interest rates have limited the expansion of industry operators as the cost of financing large projects becomes much more costly. This slowed down the pace of technological development as well, harming innovation. In addition to limited technological expansion, heightened rates have also slowed concentration at the top, as mergers and acquisitions have become much more costly. Increasing interest rates have affected downstream demand for oil and gas companies, scientific research and other smaller markets that are all sensitive to interest rate changes. Demand is set to fall across many downstream markets in 2023."

            "current_performance_point_title": "Falling government spending during 2021 harmed the growth of manufacturers",
            "current_performance_point_description": "AUV manufacturers make a significant amount of their revenue from DoD contracts and government clients. In 2021 as the economy was booming, DoD spending, as well as demand for scientific research, fell. The falling number and frequency of DoD contracts caused a massive freefall in revenue for the year. Despite the slowdown in 2021, revenue grew again in 2022 as the economy began to contract, and contracts were on the uptick again. Revenue growth was also supported by significant increases in the commercial and research downstream markets. Oil and gas companies specifically needed AUVs for finding and securing new oil sources."

            "current_performance_point_title": "Consolidation expected in the AUV industry",
            "current_performance_point_description": "New entrants demonstrating viable commercial potential are expected to be acquired by larger existing operators, leading to industry consolidation. Notable acquisitions over the past years include Huntington Ingalls's purchase of Hydroid Inc., Teledyne Technologies' acquisition of Ocean Aero Inc., and Boeing's acquisition of Liquid Robotics Inc. The industry landscape, however, remains relatively diversified, with no single company having a dominant share, providing ample room for competition and innovation. A significant reason why acquisitions were so popular during this period was the cheap debt available to companies looking to expand. However, as interest rates rise from a monetary policy from the Federal Reserve, acquisitions and mergers become a lot less likely."

However, as technology becomes increasingly essential and commercial opportunities arise, new companies are expected to be able to find footing within the industry, whether it be with private research companies or massive oil and gas companies; barriers to entry may become easier as time goes on. In the public sector, government contracts are still expected to be challenging to secure. However, the need for more advanced technology opens space for newer companies to prove themselves in the face of the giants of the defense industry."

The Large Displacement Unmanned Undersea Vehicle (Snakehead) and the Extra Large Unmanned Undersea Vehicle (Orca) are two major R&D programs expected to receive a sizeable portion of industry spending. These programs aim to develop large, long-range AUVs capable of launching from both surface ships and submarines for intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance missions. In addition to publicly funded R&D, private R&D spending, namely for Scientific research and commercial uses, is expected to grow through the period. Oil and gas companies require highly advanced technology to scout new oil deposits under the ocean as more oil dries up. So, technology will need to grow as well as depth capabilities."

Most of the demand from commercial clients comes from large oil and gas companies. The use of AUVs in deepwater exploration and oil and gas markets is forecast to be a key driver of growth, with AUVs gradually replacing ROVs for cost-efficiency and better performance. Scientific research is another piece of the commercial buyer downstream market, with oceanography, polar ice research, water sampling and fishery studies being the main subsections. The continued use of AUVs in this field is expected to support further growth of the industry through the end of the period."
