    "executive_summary": "The Acne Treatment Manufacturing OTC industry benefits from fairly stable demand because acne-prone individuals consider them a necessary expense. However, adolescents comprise the industry's largest market. High unemployment levels and low disposable incomes within this shrinking age bracket have caused sales of over-the-counter (OTC) acne treatments to drop. Moreover, the industry has been undercut by less expensive goods produced abroad. Increasingly, manufacturers have sought to locate internationally to take advantage of lower labor costs, causing imports to expand as a share of domestic demand. So, industry-wide revenue has been decreasing at a CAGR of 1.2% over the past five years, including an estimated 1.1% increase in 2023, and is expected to total $413.6 million in 2023. Further, profit is projected to decrease to 19.9% in 2023.",
