    "executive_summary": "The Fast Food Chicken Franchises industry operates franchised chicken restaurants where clients pay before eating. This industry includes take-out, delivery and purchases consumed on-site. For most of the five years to 2020, economic growth has resulted in higher levels of disposable income. Simultaneously, consumer preferences have shifted as more individuals have become more health-conscious. During the five-year period, the industry has grappled with these significant changes in downstream demand by expanding menus to include healthier alternatives. Additionally, in 2020, industry revenue has taken a hit by the COVID-19 (coronavirus) outbreak, which has reduced consumer spending levels significantly. As a result, industry revenue is expected to grow an annualized 2.5% to $30.1 billion over the five years to 2020. This includes an anticipated revenue decrease of 14.0% in 2020 alone.",
