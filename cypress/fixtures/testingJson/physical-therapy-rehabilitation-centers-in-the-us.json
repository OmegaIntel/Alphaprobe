    "executive_summary": "Figures have been adjusted for inflation and are presented in 2023 currency.\n\nFor most of the past decade, physical therapy rehabilitation centers in the US have enjoyed revenue growth as a result of an aging population since seniors aged 65 years and older are more likely to require physical therapy services as they face a higher incidence of injuries, illnesses and chronic conditions. Consumers have increasingly accepted the benefits of physical therapy services, supporting demand for the industry. However, in 2020, revenue dropped as the COVID-19 pandemic kept patients in their homes and away from inpatient facilities. The release of pent-up demand has brought back revenue growth, but inflationary pressures have muted the industry's rebound as consumers delay minor treatments not covered by their insurance plans. Industry revenue has been growing at a CAGR of 0.8% to $46.9 billion up to the end of 2023 when revenue will climb by 3.5%.\n\nDespite the economy struggling during the period, the industry remains profitable because physical therapy centers derive a large share of revenue from Medicare reimbursements. At the same time, diminished Medicare reimbursement rates have reduced the average income received per patient, dragging down profit. Although relatively steady demand has buoyed profit, a labor shortage across much of the healthcare sector has increased the wages of physical therapy rehabilitation centers.",

            "current_performance_point_description": "In the years leading up to the pandemic, the aging population, rising levels of healthcare expenditure, broader insurance coverage and broader healthcare trends all supported demand for physical therapy rehabilitation centers. COVID-19 disrupted these trends, though. The pandemic swiftly cut the accessibility and affordability of physical therapy treatment, forcing rehabilitation centers to endure a sharp drop in revenue. Unlike private practices, rehabilitation centers saw a slow recovery in 2021 as restrictions on inpatient care made it difficult to treat long-term care patients. Patient volumes have finally recovered from the pandemic's challenges in 2023. Despite fears of a recession and lingering pressure from inflation, the unavoidable nature of injuries and illnesses provides rehabilitation centers with steady demand."

If a patient needs multiple types of therapy, a physical therapy rehabilitation center is well-suited to provide those services. Many rehabilitation centers have also joined healthcare networks as the sector has moved toward consolidation. These networks can provide collaborative care by easily sharing records and referrals, reducing the burden on physical therapy (PT) clinics."

By September 2020, 75.0% of physical therapists were using telehealth. Regulatory constraints are limiting physical therapists' telehealth adoption in 2023, though. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) final ruling affirmed PT privileges ended 151 days after the end of the public health emergency."

            "current_performance_point_description": "Because of the high cost of education and a growing need for medical services that has brought heightened burnout for physical therapists, there has been an increasing shortage of potential employees in the industry. According to Definitive Healthcare, 22,000 physical therapists left the workforce in 2021 amid this burnout. Combined with the retirement of seasoned physical therapists, clinics have struggled to fill their workforces. These shortages are most acute in rural areas, where patients already experience barriers to care. Physical therapy rehabilitation centers have had better luck finding physical therapists since working in a rehabilitation facility offers more stability than private practice. Even with the added stability, rehabilitation facilities must offer competitive salaries to continue to attract skilled physical therapists. These rising wage expenditures have dragged down profit for the industry."

These acquisitions also boost their market share. While the initial investment to offer inpatient facilities can be significant, inpatient facilities can exert more substantial buying power and have greater access to high-value patients. As Medicare reimbursement rates continue to slump and operating costs grow for physical therapist practices, consolidation and investment will likely drive more businesses into the industry."

Across the healthcare sector, healthcare providers are facing a shortage of nurses, technicians and other medical staff. The high cost of education, limited wages and a surplus of healthcare job openings discourage potential physical therapists from taking up the trade. Rehabilitation centers must increase wages to maintain steady growth and avoid employee burnout. As a relatively profitable part of the healthcare sector, rehabilitation centers are well-positioned to offer competitive wages to."
