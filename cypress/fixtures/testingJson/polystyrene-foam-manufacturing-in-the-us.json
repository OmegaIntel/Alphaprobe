    "executive_summary": "Figures have been adjusted for inflation and are presented in 2023 currency. Manufacturers create polystyrene foam for various products, including insulation, food packaging containers and single-use tableware, like plates and cups. Through 2023, industry revenue is expected to strengthen at a CAGR of 3.0% to $13.3 billion, despite an expected 3.5% contraction in 2023 as demand from construction markets sharply declines. Profit has been volatile over the current period, overwhelmed by rising prices in oil and plastic. For most of the period, downstream buyers, like manufacturers, food service establishments and construction companies, have increased demand for polystyrene foam. Even so, the pandemic curtailed growth, halting spending and construction activity entirely.",

            "current_performance_point_description": "Since manufacturers derive plastic and polystyrene from petrochemical refining, the price of crude oil plays a significant role in determining raw material costs for the industry. Through 2023, crude oil prices have been extremely volatile, especially as key supply chains ground to a halt during the pandemic. In 2022, major sanctions following the Ukrainian crisis banned Russian oil, stressing domestic supply chains and causing input prices to skyrocket. Manufacturers have been unable to pass off the full cost increases to buyers, slashing profit despite a substantial recovery period in 2021."

            "current_performance_point_description": "Polystyrene foam manufacturers endure strict regulations, especially concerning polystyrene's negative environmental impact. Products are often single-use and take more than a century to decompose properly, leading to massive waste management issues. According to Seafood Source, Maryland, Maine and Vermont have responded to this concern by enacting polystyrene foam bans throughout communities."

            "current_performance_point_description": "Despite growing regulation, post-pandemic recoveries across numerous major markets have driven industry growth. The manufacturing sector has provided solid growth, especially as industrial production has rebounded after the pandemic. In particular, automotive manufacturers have increased demand, spurred by ballooning new car sales. Similarly, e-commerce sales have skyrocketed since the pandemic's onset, creating elevated demand for packing materials. Despite some states banning packing peanuts, many companies purchase custom-molded polystyrene foam to hold fragile goods like electronics."

Regarded as the nation's strongest ban relating to the issue, the Expanded Polystyrene Foam Container and Polystyrene Loose Fill Packaging Ban has been in effect since January 1, 2022. Following suit, New Jersey has joined the list of states that have enacted bans on expanded polystyrene products, enforcing the policy since May 2022. Even so, polystyrene foam manufacturers have performed well, deriving growth from markets unaffected by strict regulation."

Polystyrene-based products are also difficult to recycle and can't be processed locally. Instead, these products are transported to an external facility, creating additional costs since polystyrene displaces a large volume for its weight. The total cost of recycling and repurposing is often more than manufacturing new foam. More states will respond with restrictions on polystyrene products, further muddying the industry's image with consumers. According to Seafood Source, Colorado intends to ban polystyrene products in 2024, with Florida expected to follow."

Polyurethane, for example, competes in the same verticals as polystyrene but performs better in flexibility, general and chemical resistance, load-bearing, insulation and sound reduction. Food service establishments, for example, will turn to plastic and paper containers over polystyrene foam products. Even as the food service sector expands in the post-pandemic economy, polystyrene foam manufacturers will lose revenue to external competition. Likewise, shipping companies readily substitute polystyrene foam \"peanuts\" and molds with corrugated cardboard, paper and edible packing peanuts. While these materials provide less protection, they avoid state and local polystyrene bans. As more states issue bans, shipping companies could scrap traditional polystyrene products altogether, spelling doom for a major market."

According to Insulfoam, long lead times of polyiso insulation have pushed contractors to use expanded polystyrene as an insulation solution instead of substitute insulators. Prolonged supply chain uncertainty will create elevated demand for polystyrene foam insulation products."
