Over the five years to 2023, the industry benefited from increased corporate spending on employee wellness events, like company-hosted races. Events tailored toward sports enthusiasts and large-scale marathons increased in popularity during the period. Combined with positive conditions in the US economy that encourage spending on events, like rising consumer spending and advertising expenditure, these trends enabled the industry to expand. In 2020, the industry was negatively impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, which caused cancelations of public gatherings, like those organized by operators.
