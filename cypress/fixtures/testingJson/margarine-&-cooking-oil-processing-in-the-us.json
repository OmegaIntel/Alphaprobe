    "executive_summary": "Figures have been adjusted for inflation and are presented in 2024 currency. Margarine and cooking oil processors produce vegetable oil, shortening, margarine and starches for sale to food service establishments, food and energy producers, wholesalers and retailers. The industry grew volatile as input prices fluctuated heavily. Amid the pandemic, high prices of critical agricultural inputs drove revenue. Processors also encountered elevated demand for the industry's products, particularly nonperishable ones, in 2020 as the pandemic caused consumer stockpiling habits. Overall, revenue is anticipated to swell at a CAGR of 6.6 to $90.2 billion over the five years to 2024, despite a 2.7% dip in 2024 alone, as recovering agricultural inventories cause the industry's selling prices to drop.",

Similarly, the link between fat consumption and obesity has turned consumers away from purchasing animal fats, like lard, stimulating the market for edible vegetable oils. Several companies, like Bunge, have invested in zero trans-fat product lines to appeal to shifting consumer trends."

In particular, Spain and Italy are significant exporters of olive oil since the region offers prime olive growing conditions, making olives less expensive for processors. Similarly, Indonesia and Malaysia have chokeholds on the palm oil markets as the world's two largest palm farming countries. Indonesia, though, has cut palm oil exports to secure its domestic supply ahead of Ramadan."

The pandemic hampered international trade, making it more difficult for domestic manufacturers to source inputs. In 2022, the Russian invasion of Ukraine decimated the region's soybean and oilseed imports. Despite long-term supply contracts, processors faced massive purchasing cost increases. Since cooking oils are staple products, processors could easily pass added costs onto consumers, resulting in significant revenue and profit gains."

According to Bunge Limited, US consumers strongly oppose products made from genetically modified crops because of perceived links with health complications.

            "question": "Have exports offered an opportunity for your company?",
            "answer": "The United States is a net exporter of goods this industry produces. With rising climate change impacts worldwide, providing a steady and stable source of cooking oil can give producers a competitive edge and provide supplemental revenue when domestic sales are weak."
        },
        {
            "question": "Does your company specialize in a niche or do you produce a diversified range of products?",
            "answer": "With the rise of health consciousness among US consumers, companies in this industry have diversified their offerings of cooking oils to contain more producers that consumers would consider healthier, such as coconut and olive oils. These products are typically more expensive and may improve profit; however, demand for these specialty goods will likely suffer during economic downturns."
        },
        {
            "question": "Is your company located near key suppliers?",
            "answer": "To minimize transportation costs, operators in this industry locate themselves near strategic sources of inputs, such as significant oilseed, soybean or corn growing areas. Manufacturers with greater control over their supply chains typically experience greater profitability and are less likely to suffer as frequently or severely from supply chain disruption."
        },
        {
            "question": "Has your company been exposed to volatile input prices?",
            "answer": "Cooking oil producer revenue highly depends on the price of critical inputs. Corn and oilseed prices have increased over the past five years, boosting revenue. Companies that can secure low-price inputs now may earn more significant profit as prices and selling prices rise during the outlook period."
        },
        {
            "question": "Have you been able to reduce wage costs through automation?",
            "answer": "Margarine and cooking oil production requires costly machinery, so many producers allocate funds toward capital purchases. Wage costs can be mitigated by investing in automated technologies requiring fewer physical workers. However, such technologies are often price-prohibitive."
        },
        {
            "question": "Do you use SAP software systems to optimize all aspects of your company's manufacturing, sales, inventory and distribution channels?",
            "answer": "Large cooking oil producers have already adopted computerized systems for managing customer and supplier arrangements, resulting in cost savings through better inventory and production planning."
        },
        {
            "question": "Do you work with trade associations or other interest groups to advance your company's interests?",
            "answer": "The Corn Refiners Association, American Fats and Oils Association and the US Canola Association are the main associations supporting margarine and cooking oil producers."
        },
        {
            "question": "Have any regulatory expenses significantly affected profitability recently?",
            "answer": "The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has in the past imposed civil penalties on certain operators in this industry for violations of the Clean Water Act. New workplace safety standards may lead to an increase in operating expense."
        },
        {
            "question": "How does your company's profit compare to your main competitors'?",
            "answer": "Adding more profitable product lines or secure low-cost inputs can help companies outperform industry peers. Securing a stable supply of inputs can help producers reduce volatility, gain a loyal customer base and boost profit."
        },
        {
            "question": "Do you have any big projects on the horizon that will require capital financing?",
            "answer": "Margarine and cooking oil producers invest significantly in capital, so new plants or expansions often require outside financing. High interest rates typically deter producers from making costly expansions, as few can pay for such services in cash."
        },
        {
            "question": "How strong is your relationship with your input supplier? Do you have many input suppliers?",
            "answer": "Successful companies secure contracts with suppliers of key inputs, especially soybeans and corn, to lock in prices and ensure a stable supply of raw goods. Guaranteed supplies at established prices help minimize purchase costs and assist production planning."
        },
        {
            "question": "What proportion of your sales comes from exports? Do you trade with any specific countries?",
            "answer": "Successful companies seek to export industry-specific products to foreign markets to increase their overall market presence while also reducing exposure to any singular market."
        },
        {
            "question": "What opportunities are available to increase the scale of your business? Do you experience competition based on economies of scale?",
            "answer": "Larger processors benefit from lower per unit costs due to efficiency gains achieved from economies of scale. Some industry players have acquired smaller companies as a means to improve economies of scale and reduce operating costs."
        },
        {
            "question": "How have falling corn prices affected your financial performance? How price elastic are your products and how do you sustain profit when input prices change significantly?",
            "answer": "As the price of corn rises, operators can either pass on the cost increases to downstream customers or absorb the costs."
        },
        {
            "question": "What proportion of your revenue is derived from food manufacturers? Do you plan to work with more food manufacturers in the future?",
            "answer": "Food manufacturers use products from the Margarine and Cooking Oil Processing industry as inputs for their products."
        },
        {
            "question": "Does international trade play a significant role in your company's operations? Do you track changes in the trade-weighted index?",
            "answer": "When the US dollar appreciates, domestic goods are relatively more expensive and imports' share of domestic demand increases."
