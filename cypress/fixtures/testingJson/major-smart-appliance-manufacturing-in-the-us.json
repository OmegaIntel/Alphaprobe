Revenue for the industry has surged during the current period because major smart appliances have become less expensive and more accessible to consumers, enabling manufacturers to sell to most households for the first time.

High wage growth in the years preceding the pandemic caused incomes to surge, benefiting the industry in 2018 and 2019. Massive government aid during COVID-19 gave consumers tons of cash. They used this money during the pandemic and the recovery to buy smart appliances, which raised revenue in 2020 and 2021."

Supply chain disruptions have caused prices of key inputs (e.g. steel, plastic) to skyrocket during the pandemic recovery, causing revenue to soar in 2021. Buyers will eventually purchase traditional appliances if input prices become too high, so the industry can only benefit from higher costs up to a point."

Many households will have already purchased major smart appliances by the mid-2020s, so the market for the industry's products will become saturated. Saturation makes it harder for manufacturers to find new customers, so revenue will increase at a much slower rate than during the current period."
