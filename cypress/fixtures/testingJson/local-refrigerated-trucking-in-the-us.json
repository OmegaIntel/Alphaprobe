    "executive_summary": "The local refrigerated trucking industry engages frequently with several downstream markets. General retail and groceries make up the largest share of demand. During the period, the retail and grocery segment contributed the most to the demand by far. As the country holed up inside in 2020, consumer demand from the food services industry dropped, while consumer demand for groceries inversely rose. This jump in demand for groceries helped to stave off any further revenue declines related to COVID-19. 2021 led to a strong recovery as in person activities opened up again.",

Growing ecommerce demand since the early 2010's has benefitted operators, however COVID-19 shutdowns caused an even larger increase in demand since consumers hunkered down inside and avoided outside contact. COVID-19 also acted as a catalyst for heightened ecommerce growth during the period, as a lot of consumers replaced traditional shopping with online, even after the pandemic subsided."

As most consumers remained inside for a year, demand for groceries and other refrigerated goods grew significantly during 2020. Demand for groceries were so high at points during the pandemic that stores were having a difficult time keeping items on shelves. This stock shortage was brought about by panic buying from consumers, effecting essential household and perishable goods. While this was bad for consumers, it meant local refrigerated trucking was in demand during the downturn."

            "current_performance_point_description": "Inflation has surged recently, causing the Federal Reserve to increase interest rates to tame prices. The elevated cost of borrowing has made it more expensive for corporations to borrow money for new office space and other nonresidential structures, hindering demand from construction. Since construction companies are major buyers of local specialized freight trucking, elevated interest rates have hurt the industry. High-interest rates have also threatened consumer demand, creating recessionary fears. These fears have made businesses reluctant to spend, inhibiting spending on local specialized freight trucking. Easing supply chains have reduced energy prices, causing surcharge revenue to decline. Falling gas prices have contributed to the drop in revenue the industry has experienced recently."

With the potential introduction of self-driving trucks within the decade, operators will likely reduce workforce investments, leading to slower employment growth. Consequently, trucking companies are expected to invest more capital into a better, more technologically advanced fleet of trucks and logistic software. This shift to automation can aid the industry by boosting operational efficiency, and cutting down both time and cost."

Since these prices were abnormally high recently, they encouraged companies to shut down or stop doing business with truckers, causing revenue to fall. Prices that fall from these historic highs will increase business again, boosting revenue. If the prices fall too much, it will reduce surcharge revenue for local specialized freight truckers, hindering revenue and profitability for the industry. While trucking companies have benefited from the drop in energy prices from their historic highs, energy prices will decline precipitously during the outlook period, which will have a negative effect on the industry overall."

Heightened interest rates made fleet expansion and replacement much more costly. Which caused dampened expansion and profit growth. Interest rates are expected to be reeled back in during the beginning of the next period, as inflation falls back to a manageable level. Further expansion of fleets, product offerings and scope of business can be expected as a result."
