    "executive_summary": "Operators in the Boat Rental industry offer various boats and watercraft for rental. Boats are generally more expensive to rent than other entertainment alternatives, therefore, demand is dependent on high levels of disposable income and consumer confidence. Industry revenue increased each year during the current period, except in 2020, as the industry struggled amid the pandemic because of travel restrictions and temporary lockdown measures. Altogether, over the past five years, revenue has grown at a CAGR of 1.9% to $5.3 billion, including an expected 0.7% increase in 2024. Profit is expected to climb to 7.3% of revenue in 2024 from 7.1% in 2019.",

However, consumer confidence and domestic trips by US residents plummeted in 2020. When domestic trips by US residents decline, it typically results in reduced boat rental activity, as boats are often rented on vacation. Industry demand was significantly reduced in 2020 due to pandemic lockdown measures and travel restrictions. In addition, total recreation expenditure, which tracks the total amount spent by US consumers on recreation services per year, shrunk, contributing to industry revenue declines."

Similar to the home rental operator Airbnb Inc., customers can rent boats directly from owners or operators on water-based sharing apps. Customers can search where and when they want to rent the boat, a preferred hourly price, the number of passengers and the type of boating they are seeking. The increasing popularity of these applications has raised competition in the industry, while simultaneously lowering the barriers to rent a boat for consumers."

However, the Boat Rentals industry experienced solid growth for most of the current period, in line with rising disposable income and leisure time spent. Ultimately, industry revenue grew substantially in 2021. Increased per capita disposable income levels enabled individuals to rent boats with increased frequency. Furthermore, pent-up demand for tourism following the pandemic has benefitted operators, as tourists are likely to rent boats for daily excursions or the duration of their vacation. The myriad of options operators provide, as well as the number of activities in which boating enables an individual to participate in, including wakeboarding and fishing, has helped the industry entice consumers from diverse backgrounds."

As more services are conducted online and time spent online by consumers is anticipated to rise, operators will likely need to maintain an online presence to entice customers and draw from a larger potential market. In addition, sharing platforms are anticipated to reach boats in additional bodies of water in the United States. For example, GetMyBoat, which is the world's largest boat rental and water experience marketplace, has grown from primarily operating in top US boating cities such as Miami, to having boats available in 9,300 destinations across 184 countries. The rising popularity of boat rentals is likely to entice larger operators to enter the industry, raising competition."
