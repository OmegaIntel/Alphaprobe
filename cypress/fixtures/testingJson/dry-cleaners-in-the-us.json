    "executive_summary": "The industry includes dry cleaning and full-service laundry establishments that cater to household consumers and commercial clients such as hotels and restaurants. Dry cleaners may also offer specialty cleaning services for delicate garments and textiles. Over the past five years, the industry has experienced difficult operating conditions. Declining demand for professional dry-cleaning services, unfavorable shifts in consumer preferences and increasing competition from coin-operated laundromats, franchised establishments and substitute products have led to the industry's decline. Also, COVID-19 and the economic downturn resulted in drastic revenue declines in 2020. Consequently, industry revenue is expected to fall at a CAGR of 4.9% to $8.3 billion over the past five years, with a rise of 1.1% in 2024 alone.",

The pandemic has significantly exacerbated these trends since unemployed and financially insecure consumers either had no need for dry cleaning services or could not afford them. Also, work-from-home policies have resulted in an even greater shift to casual attire at the workplace, reducing demand for dry cleaning services. Amid these declines, cleaners have experienced rising operational costs and slim profit. Many have been forced to exit the industry or attempt to cut costs by drastically reducing their workforce."

        {
            "question": "How does your company fair amid economic downturns?",
            "answer": "Periods of declining or disrupted economic activity result in significantly detrimental effects on industry revenue. Dry cleaning services are relatively expensive and there are myriad substitute products and services available, which are generally less expensive. As a result, operators experienced significant declines in demand as cash-strapped consumers opted to forgo dry cleaning services or use less expensive substitute products."
        },
        {
            "question": "How has your company adjusted pricing strategies amid economic downturns to maintain consumers?",
            "answer": "Due to the high and rising level of competition, both internally and externally, operators experience difficulty effectively passing rising costs on to customers. As a result, operators with strong brand recognition or consumer loyalty are best equipped to weather economic disruptions."
        },
        {
            "question": "Does your company offer ancillary services to supplement revenue during periods of declining demand?",

Operators can stay abreast of these changes by frequenting association websites, such as the National Cleaners Association and American Drycleaner."
        },
        {
            "question": "How does your company comply and stay abreast of the evolving regulatory landscape in relation to environmental standards for dry cleaning practices?",
            "answer": "Operators must adhere to a variety of environmentally-related regulations, as chemicals traditionally used in dry cleaning practices have been identified as increasingly harmful to various components of the environment. The EPA provides operators with guidance and instructions on changes in regulations that pertain to their equipment and chemicals used, including the prohibition of new installation of PCE dry-cleaning machines."

            "answer": "Radio-frequency identification systems (RFID) have become increasingly important for industry operators, as they deal with many pieces of clothing and the systems enable operators to easily sort them and remain organized. Additionally, over the past five years, many operators have replaced their PCE machines with washers that use carbon dioxide or high-temperature hydrocarbons, such as DF2000 or EcoSolve."

            "answer": "Operators specializing in serving markets relatively unaffected by the pandemic and nonessential business closures, particularly health care markets.

        {
            "question": "How has your company managed increased competition?",
            "answer": "Franchised establishments have become an increasingly prevalent form of external competition for industry operators, as many prior participants in the industry have converted to franchised operations, bringing their brand recognition and experience to a competing industry. Operators experience difficulty offering different services from franchises, along with lower prices, as franchises generally stay abreast of changing consumer preferences and can offer lower prices due to economies of scale."
