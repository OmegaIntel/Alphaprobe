    "executive_summary": "Amusement parks have experienced notable fluctuations in recent years, greatly influenced by external factors like the global pandemic and the spike in tourism that followed. As travel restrictions lifted, amusement parks saw a surge in visitor numbers from both domestic and international tourists. By 2024, although revenue growth had slowed year-to-year, the industry benefitted from the sustained tourism boom. Despite the surge in attendance, profit has yet to fully recover.",

            "current_performance_point_description": "Amusement parks maintain high fixed costs, so without an influx of visitors in 2020, parks were operating at a loss. Increased travel after the pandemic's peak benefited amusement parks, as many operate in popular tourist areas with high traffic. When amusement parks reopened, pent-up demand and vaccine availability quickly ushered in a period of solid recovery. By 2021, the removal of travel restrictions bolstered interest in amusement parks as international visitors could come to the US."

Undertaking these new ventures is a significant risk, especially if companies overpromise and underdeliver. In 2022, Disneyworld opened its Star Wars: Galactic Cruiser hotel, a two-day immersive experience that promised guests themed activities, character interactions and role-playing opportunities. Ultimately, the time and money they had to invest in the experience was a big barrier for many consumers and the project failed to generate sufficient demand."

Instead of parents watching from the sidelines, families today prefer enjoying rides together. Between full-size and kiddie coasters, there are family coasters designed to accommodate riders of different ages. While these have been a staple at Disney Parks for years, new rides like The Bobcat at Six Flags Great Escape and Pheonix Rising at Busch Gardens Tampa Bay aim to attract families and thrill-seekers alike."

The biggest corporations will turn more attention to the international tourist market. Amusement parks will increasingly offer attractive packages and discounts to continue stimulating attendance. All-inclusive vacation packages that provide resort accommodations and park admissions are particularly advantageous for the largest theme parks to lock in customers."

Even with the introduction of new attractions, the biggest amusement parks risk pricing out lower-income consumers and hitting a profit wall. While demand remains high, constant price hikes may turn amusement parks into a luxury only a few can afford, limiting a park's reach and profitability in the long run."
