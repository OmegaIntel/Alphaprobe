    "executive_summary": "Companies in the Farm Product Storage and Warehousing industry operate bulk farm product warehousing and storage facilities. Industry performance depends on the agricultural market and related international trade, as storage companies generate revenue by transporting, storing and packing agricultural goods. Farm-level decisions on when and how much of that agricultural output to store are subject to numerous influences that may be volatile in nature. Due to this, industry performance shifts each year. For example, weather patterns affect crop yields, while global production and demand drive prices. Based on these factors, farmers decide what products to store to maximize profit in a given season. Altogether, Farm Product Storage and Warehousing industry revenue has inched downward at a CAGR of 0.8% over the past five years and is expected to total $977.8 million in 2023, when revenue will jump by an estimated 0.9%.\n\nWhen farmers encounter lower commodity prices, they are more likely to store grain in anticipation of future price appreciation. In addition to domestic markets, the industry is influenced by global agricultural trade trends, as the industry facilitates the export of US crops and provides value-added services, such as grain drying and prepackaging. The appreciation of the US dollar can negatively influence industry revenue, making US goods relatively more expensive to foreign buyers. Industry performance over the past five years has been affected by increasing demand for US agricultural exports, declining domestic consumption of wheat and corn-based sweeteners and some disintermediation of storage companies from supply chains. Also, the industry was severely affected amid the COVID-19 pandemic, which negatively affected industry revenue due to declining export volumes.\n\nIndustry revenue will recover over the five years to 2028, although contending largely with the same conflicting demand trends. Due to increased demand from developing countries, US agricultural exports will remain strong. Still, a continued decline in consumption of wheat and corn-based sweeteners by health-conscious domestic consumers will hurt demand for corn and wheat storage domestically. Farm Product Storage and Warehousing industry revenue is expected to inch upward at a CAGR of 0.9% to $1.0 billion over the five years to 2028.",

The China-led soybean export boom has also been bolstered by the signing of the Phase 1 trade agreement between the US in China.

Due to this, this segment's share of revenue has increased over the past five years.
