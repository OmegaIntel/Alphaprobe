At the same time, innovative tech advances improve the sound quality, aesthetics and comfort of hearing aids, broadening their appeal. Still, US-based manufacturing facilities have struggled. Import penetration has risen \u2013 an outcome of companies shifting US production facilities to countries where labor is more affordable. COVID-19 exacerbated volatility as manufacturers confronted a disrupted global supply chain, heightened input costs, weak demand and a strong US dollar. Hearing sales lost steam in 2022 again as inflation hurt consumers' wallets, but a massive regulatory change beginning at the tail end of 2022 reversed these trends.",
