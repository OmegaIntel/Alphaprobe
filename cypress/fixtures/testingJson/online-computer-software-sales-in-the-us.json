There is a wide range of computer software applications currently available and that continue to be launched yearly for both business and personal use, leading the Online Computer Software Sales industry to have numerous vertical markets. The industry has largely benefited from the gradual digital transformation that runs concurrently with macroeconomic growth. However, while many facets of the global economy have suffered during COVID-19 and accompanying economic burdens, online retailers have benefited tremendously from increased digital screen time for work and leisure purposes. So, industry-wide revenue has been increasing at a CAGR of 6.0% over the past five years, including an estimated 2.6% increase in 2023, with revenue expected to total $709.0 billion in 2023. In the same year, profit is projected to increase to 2.1%.",
