    "executive_summary": "The industry, which rents out photo booths for events, weddings and other parties, performed well over the five years to 2024. This enhanced level of performance is due to the sharp economic recovery as COVID restrictions dissipated, enabling social events to resume uninhibited. Nonetheless, intense competition from smartphone cameras has mitigated the industry's overall rise. The industry has responded to shifting consumer preferences by increasing the number of nonemployer professionals who can offer rental services at a lower rate than large, established companies. Still, the COVID-19 pandemic precipitated a massive decline in revenue in 2020 as photo booth rental companies and their clients were prohibited from gathering together, but this has been completely rectified and trends have reversed.",

Ages 20 to 35 have a minor need for family portraits, but they're significant customers of wedding photography services. People between 36 and 55 account for the largest share of demand for photo booths since they are more likely to get married, have kids and have disposable income."

Businesses often use photo booths and other photography services for marketing and advertising, along with getting photos for publications, including annual reports, brochures and training materials. Business clients often rent out more expensive photo booths compared with households and they also keep them for a prolonged period of time, making them a high-revenue and high-margin market. Demand from this market will continue rising over the outlook period alongside gains in corporate profit. This will enable businesses to have more funding available to boost their advertisements and for any other photo booth uses."

Philanthropic organizations leverage photo booths to document the progress and challenges of their initiatives, serving as compelling storytelling tools for fundraising and awareness campaigns. Photo booths are often rented out for key events such as fundraisers or charity marathons, which later help draw continued support from donors. Still, these outside sources frequently have their in-house photography teams or do not have the resources to contract external photographic services, so the amount of income derived is relatively limited."
