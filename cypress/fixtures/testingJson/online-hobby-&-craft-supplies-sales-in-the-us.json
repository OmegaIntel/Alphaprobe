    "executive_summary": "The online hobby and craft supplies industry experienced relatively strong operating conditions over the past five years to 2023, compared to brick-and-mortar counterparts. Revenue from online sales is expected to increase at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 1.8% to reach $13.4 billion in 2023, including 1.8% growth in 2023 alone. Consumer spending grew amid economic recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic. E-commerce sales rose, with more business shifting online due to social distancing guidelines, contributing to revenue growth. However, profit fluctuated but stabilized by 2023. Looking ahead to 2028, revenue is projected to expand at a faster CAGR of 2.3% as the percentage of online business reaches saturation from the pandemic shift.",
