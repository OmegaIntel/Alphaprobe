    "executive_summary": "The popularity of dance as a medium for fitness, artistic expression and social interaction has kept the industry on an upward trajectory, despite setbacks in recent years. Dance studios have seen a remarkable rebound following the pandemic's disruptive impact. The forced closure of dance studios and the shift to virtual classes initially strained many businesses, but studios demonstrated resilience. By 2021 and 2022, amid relaxing stay-at-home orders and the return of in-person courses, studios experienced higher in-person attendance. The pent-up demand for in-studio practice compensated for previous losses and contributed to a resurgence in enrollment. Over the last few years, revenue has grown at a CAGR of 3.5% to $5.4 billion and will expand at 2.6% in 2024.",
