However, a surge in revenue during the COVID-19 pandemic offset other losses. Tuition has climbed as higher-cost private schools gained dominance, but not enough to generate positive long-term revenue growth. The industry owes its net revenue growth since 2019 to the pandemic making private schools more attractive. Revenue climbed at a 1.9% CAGR to reach $98.9 billion over the past five years, despite sinking 1.7% in 2024.",
