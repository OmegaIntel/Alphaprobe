    "executive_summary": "Colocation has experienced impressive growth over the past five years as companies shifted operations online during the pandemic. An intermediate step between internal server hosting and leasing space from a cloud provider, colocation services offer a middle ground. Operators of colocation services build a space conducive to computing, with massive electrical infrastructure, cooling capacity and high security. Still, clients will fill the racks they rent every year with their own servers, dramatically increasing hardware deployment speed and data security. This business model is most attractive to moderately sized businesses located within physical proximity of the colocation center to enable moderate oversight of the hardware. As a result, revenue will increase at a CAGR of 6.7% over the five years to 2023, reaching $55.4 billion, including growth of 6.9% in that year.",

Many enterprises chose to take advantage of colocation centers' ability to scale up resources rapidly by adding additional servers quickly and easily. The high level of security and monitoring offered by these facilities established them as an attractive option for organizations more concerned than ever with data safety and integrity."

This has led some organizations to seek out alternative cloud hosting solutions as colocation facilities charge high prices to filter out only the most interested buyers. Furthermore, some data storage providers offer hybrid solutions that combine virtual and dedicated server environments depending on the customer's specific requirements, eliminating the need for colocation facilities entirely."

While an increasing number of colocation centers already run on 100.0% renewable energy, those which use fueled backup or grid sources of electricity have had to increase prices despite negotiating directly with utilities. For colocation centers in arid regions, renewable water supplies have also dried up; some locations will move to more expensive direct air cooling systems in the years ahead or find other exotic cooling solutions."

Colocation servers have doubled down on protecting their clients' hardware. Biometric recognition is relatively popular for limiting physical access to the building, while physical monitoring systems automatically alert clients to access of their server cages. Some colocation centers use a new model to secure data called edge computing. By combining a relatively secure data center network and processing sensitive information at each, colocation centers and their clients can reduce the impact of a physical intrusion."

While running an AI for client-facing servers is compute-intensive enough, training one can take months of hard computing work which the major cloud providers will lend, if at a pretty penny.

However, technology companies are most likely to realize the benefits of colocation instead of simply leasing space from a primary cloud provider.",
