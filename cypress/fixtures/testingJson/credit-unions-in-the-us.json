        {
            "question": "Has your company been exposed to volatile prices over the past few years?",
            "answer": "Yes, volatility in interest rates affects loan demand, which affects credit union demand."

        },
        {
            "question": "How has the volatility of interest rates affected profit margins over the past months?",
            "answer": "Volatile interest rates affect the interest spread in which credit unions earn income and the pricing of credit union investments. Credit unions favor paying interest rates on deposits lower than they charge on loans."

            "question": "Are you located close to your members? How can you increase accessibility and convenience for your members?",

        },
        {
            "question": "What are your main sources of competition? How do you differentiate your services from those of large commercial banks?",
            "answer": "Competition is mainly based on interest rates charged on loans, rates of return guaranteed on deposits, quality of service and the availability and range of products relative to other financial institutions. Credit unions have historically out-competed banks in customer service."
        },
        {
            "question": "Do you keep track of the prime rate? Has your company monitored trends in loan demand?",

        },
        {
            "question": "Do you keep track of the aggregate household debt? How are you affected by fluctuations in aggregate household debt?",
            "answer": "The text does not mention if credit unions track aggregate household debt. However, it states that aggregate household debt is highly correlated with consumer confidence, which affects the level of debt consumers choose to hold and strongly influences private consumption. An increase in aggregate household debt increases demand for industry services."
