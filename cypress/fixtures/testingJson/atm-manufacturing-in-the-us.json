    "executive_summary": "Over the past five years, ATM manufacturers have faced a steady decline in demand that forced many manufacturers to permanently close up shop. Consumers are using cash less often than ever, making ATMs less needed in consumers' day-to-day lives. What little demand for ATMs remains is mostly being captured by imports, especially from South Korea and Mexico, as companies in these nations can leverage cheaper labor to undercut the prices of domestic manufacturers. This also puts tense price competition on the industry, compressing profit. Industry-wide revenue has been dropping at a CAGR of 3.4% over the past five years and is expected to total $354.5 million in 2023, when revenue is projected to sink 1.5%.",

Apps like Venmo and Apple Pay are also threatening the industry by making cash less relevant in consumers' lives, which in turn cuts demand for ATMs. The COVID-19 pandemic rapidly accelerated this decline as consumers heavily shifted to online services and contactless payment options that bypass the industry. While financial clients and other buyers brought back some revenue growth in 2021, industry revenue has yet to make a full recovery."

The percentage of business conducted online and e-commerce sales are both set to steadily rise over the next five years, indicating growing consumer preference for online shopping platforms like Amazon, which don't have options for cash payments.

While demand for ATMs will still fall through the end of 2028, host processors will no longer support ATMs without the proper equipment after the deadline. This means banking institutions and independent operators that wish to continue offering an ATM will need to update their machines. This boost is set to temper losses, but revenue is expected to continue declining as ATM owners opt for lower-cost parts to retrofit their machines and bring them up to current standards, rather than fully replacing them with new models."
