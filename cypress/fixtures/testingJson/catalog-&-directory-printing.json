    "executive_summary": "The Catalog and Directory Printing industry uses the process of lithography to print catalogs and directories. Offset lithography is a printing process, based on the immiscibility of grease and water, in which a patterned polymer is applied to a plastic or metal plate. The ink is then transferred to paper via a rubber plate or cylinder. The industry has long been supported by the low operating costs of lithographic printing. However, similar to the broader Printing industry, the Catalog and Directory Printing industry is contending with long-term decline. Over the five years to 2022, industry revenue is expected to fall an annualized 7.2% to $2.0 billion. As businesses recover from the COVID-19 pandemic, industry operators have experienced temporary relief in 2021 and 2022, with revenue climbing an estimated 1.6% in 2022.",
