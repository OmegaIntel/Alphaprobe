    "executive_summary": "Photofinishing service providers have struggled to remain relevant as consumers adapt to the digital age. Photography has become almost exclusively digital, eliminating the need for traditional capital-intensive film development, while the widespread accessibility of a smartphone camera has made professional photography available even to the budding novice. Growing usage of online photo sharing platforms has satisfied the need for physical photo prints. While suppressed disposable income limits industry growth, heightened competition from online retailers and phone applications has depressed demand for industry services. Thus, industry revenue has been declining at a CAGR of 2.8% over the past five years, reaching an estimated $1.5 billion in 2024, with a slight rise of 0.5% in 2024 alone.",
