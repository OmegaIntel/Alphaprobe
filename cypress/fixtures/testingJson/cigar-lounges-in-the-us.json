Cigar lounges took a large hit following the outbreak of coronavirus in the United States, which prompted a shutdown of nonessential businesses. Industry revenue plummeted 4.8% in 2020. Post-COVID growth was short lived, with revenue growing only 0.7% in 2021 before falling 7.4% in 2022. Overall, industry revenue has been falling at a CAGR of 2.1% over the past five years and is expected to reach $730.4 million through the end of 2023. This includes an estimated 1.8% drop in 2023 alone.",
