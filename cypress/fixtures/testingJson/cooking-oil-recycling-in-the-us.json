Government support has helped stabilize demand during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Theft of cooking oil has continued to become more common, with New York's East Hampton Star asking the question \"Is Used Cooking Oil the New Copper?\" With such high rates of theft, many restaurants are willing to make less money off their used cooking oil to avoid inventory losses."
