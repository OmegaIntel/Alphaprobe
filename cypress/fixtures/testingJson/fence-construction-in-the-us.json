    "executive_summary": "Fence contractors have enjoyed solid growth over the past five years. Growth in residential building construction activity was a boon to fence contractors. Surging housing starts and private spending on home improvements spurred by low interest rates and higher disposable income levels led to solid expansion. Nonetheless, interest rate hikes led to a slowdown in the residential market. The nonresidential construction market recovering from pandemic-induced declines offset slower growth in the residential market. Overall, revenue has been increasing at a CAGR of 1.4% over the past five years to total an estimated $20.6 billion in 2024, including an estimated increase of 0.2%.",

Simultaneously, private spending on home improvements rose as consumers sought to increase their homes' value amid escalating prices, bolstering expenditure on new fences and repair and maintenance of existing fences. As interest rates rose, there was a slowdown in housing starts and a decline in private spending on home improvements."

Despite interest rate hikes, the nonresidential market has begun recovering from pandemic-induced declines. As the economy reopened, fence contractors enjoyed solid growth from hotels and resorts as pent-up demand for travel spurred investment by these businesses."

Climbing wood prices have compounded the expansion of plastic fence expenditures as consumers have opted for the less expensive material. Despite surging steel prices pushing up the cost of metal fences, the aesthetic appeal of these fences has contributed to greater expenditure in both the residential and nonresidential markets, particularly for ornamental fences."
