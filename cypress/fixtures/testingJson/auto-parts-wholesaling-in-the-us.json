    "executive_summary": "Revenue for the Auto Parts Wholesaling industry has grown at an estimated CAGR of 2.3% to reach $278.7 billion in 2023, when revenue is set to grow 3.1% as the number of motor vehicle registrations and per capita disposable income both rise. Amid widespread stay-at-home orders, unemployment spiked in 2020, discouraging consumers from making large purchases, including automobiles. However, while some consumers are driving less now that they're working from home, demand for auto parts has rebounded along with vehicle registrations. Industry profit, measured as earnings before interest and taxes, has grown slightly as wholesalers have been able to pass along rising costs.",
