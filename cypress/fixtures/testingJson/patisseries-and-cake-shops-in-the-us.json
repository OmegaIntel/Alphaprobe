    "executive_summary": "Figures have been adjusted for inflation and are presented in 2024 currency. The Patisseries and Cake Shops industry has expanded over the past five years. The industry has recently benefited from growing consumer income, enabling shoppers to splurge on baked goods. To the industry's benefit, the healthy eating index has declined, depicting that more consumers are willing to consume less healthy food, such as patisseries and cakes. However, the industry has contended with falling sugar and sweetener consumption, which are some of the industry's main inputs. Overall, consumers still try to stay away from sugar-rich desserts. Over the past five years, industry revenue is expected to rise an annualized 2.2% to $5.4 billion, including an anticipated 0.3% decline in 2024 alone. Industry profit has suffered from rising sugar prices, the industry's primary input.",
