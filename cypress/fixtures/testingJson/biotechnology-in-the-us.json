    "executive_summary": "Figures have been adjusted for inflation and are presented in 2024 currency. Explosive growth in biotechnology in recent years can't be understated. What's fueling this rapid growth varies, as biotech's applications span from healthcare and agriculture to manufacturing. COVID-19 brought more attention to biotechnology, as biotech was central to vaccine development and a reopening economy. Biotech's potential to develop vaccines shifted the industry's trajectory, with investment reaching unprecedented levels and over 150 biotech producers going public in 2021. But, growing investor uncertainty through 2023 translated into a funding slowdown for biotechnology. While a funding resurgence in 2024 has given biotechnology companies a reprieve, investors remain cautious as interest rates remain high. Despite recent challenges, revenue has been expanding at a CAGR of 7.2% to an estimated $215.4 billion over the past five years, with an expected growth of 2.0% in 2024.",
