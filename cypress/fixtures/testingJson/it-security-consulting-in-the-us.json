IT security consultants continue to benefit from the increasing adoption of e-commerce, social networking and cloud computing across private and public clients.\n\nIncreased online usage amid the pandemic further fueled growth, even as broader economic conditions cratered, as more downstream clients shifted their operations toward the online space. The growing prevalence of high-profile cybersecurity attacks and the risks associated with potential data breaches will continue to propel demand, particularly among larger businesses and corporate clients. Over the past five years, revenue grew at a CAGR of 3.7% to an estimated $17.6 billion, including an estimated 2.7% in 2024\n\nThese trends will also favor profit, as economic stabilization following high inflation and a greater embrace of digitization will stabilize profitability.",

The emphasis on cybersecurity, coupled with rising demand, will drive continued growth among consultants, with new safeguards such as the Zero Trust Cyber Security system, which treats all devices as potential threats, creating greater demand for qualified consultants. State governments will turn to IT security consultants to protect the vast amount of information held in state databases. US citizens have become increasingly concerned with protecting their private information not only from cyber criminals but from the US government itself. After Edward Snowden leaked highly sensitive National Security Agency (NSA) documents, US citizens became aware of an NSA program that collects millions of Americans' telephone records, claiming that bulk collection had contributed to the prevention of possible terrorist attacks. Concerns of US citizens with the protection of privacy and civil liberties stimulate change and demand for IT security services, including the development of new end-to-end encryption standards."
