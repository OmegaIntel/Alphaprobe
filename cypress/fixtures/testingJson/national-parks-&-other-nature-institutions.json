    "executive_summary": "National parks and other nature institutions include operators engaged in the preservation and exhibition of natural areas or settings. Industry revenue is based on self-generated revenue, including admission fees, on-premise concession and accommodation sales and private donations and grants. Over the five years to 2023, steady visitor rates and a surge in environmental awareness kept revenue afloat. The COVID-19 pandemic significantly dampened profit during the period, so the reopening of the economy since then has significantly helped this industry, with revenue growth reaching 8.5% in 2021 alone.",

Industry operators have increased or introduced admission fees or have bolstered on-site product and service offerings, resulting in revenue gains. Still, many have struggled with rising operational costs, with the largest industry operator, the National Park Service, reporting an $18.0 billion deficit."

Larger operators, such as the NPS, attract consumers from across the globe. Consumers traveling long distances to visit an industry establishment are more likely to spend greater sums on costly industry services, like on-site accommodations, guided tours and events. As a result, nonlocal day trip visitors and overnight visitors have historically accounted for more than three-quarters of industry revenue."

Increasing per capita disposable income in the period will also enable more Americans to go on vacations, including overnight visits to parks. This will likely increase spending per visit, as overnight travelers make more impulse purchases, buy expensive souvenirs and food and splurge on luxury services, like boat and helicopter tours."

The COVID-19 pandemic has put a brief halt to this sector of the industry as schools were similarly shut down for the year or were put on a very restricted schedule that prevented these field trips from happening. With the reopening of all aspects of the country including K-12 schools in 2021, demand for this industry will return to pre-pandemic levels."

Industry establishments have long been viewed as a budget-friendly alternative for vacations and day trips. mounting deficits and rising operational costs have forced many operators to enact or raise admission fees, a trend that is forecast to become even more prevalent over the next five years."
