    "executive_summary": "Outlet stores are establishments that sell goods directly from manufacturers to consumers. Historically, outlet stores have been known for low-quality goods at bargain prices. However recently, major retailers have broken into the industry, exclusively selling name-brand products directly from the manufacturing line. These products are usually out of season and heavily discounted. Outlet stores have largely struggled through the end of 2024 because of the COVID-19 pandemic and inflation. Consumer spending has fallen as households contend with the ballooning cost of living. Revenue has fallen at a CAGR of 4.0% through the end of 2024 to reach $64.6 billion, with the most significant depression in 2022 amid rapid inflation. Profit has fallen slightly from 3.3% in 2019 to 3.1% in 2024. Still, revenue is expected to climb 1.6% in 2024 alone. This is expected to signal growth on the horizon, with outlet stores faring better as interest rates cool and the effects of the pandemic ultimately abate. This will likely encourage consumer spending, leading to a surge in retail activity. However, outlet stores must contend with the growing threat of online retail. Outlets can mitigate losses by forming closer bonds with manufacturers to purchase bulk goods at low prices. Overall outlet store revenue is expected to creep upward at a CAGR of 0.9% to reach $67.5 billion.",

Consequently, goods sold at outlet stores are lucrative to price-conscious consumers. Due to the lower-than-retail prices of overstocked goods, industry demand is somewhat less sensitive to negative changes in the broader economy. Demand is expected to perform better than other retail industries when the broader economy enters a downturn."
