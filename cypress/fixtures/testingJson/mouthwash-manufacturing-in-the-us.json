    "executive_summary": "Figures have been adjusted for inflation and are presented in 2024 currency.\n\nMouthwash producers have endured considerable volatility in recent years. The state of the economy directly impacts mouthwash sales, as consumers opt to postpone making discretionary purchases, including mouthwash, when macroeconomic conditions are unfavorable. During the early stages of the pandemic, sales were negatively impacted by jumping unemployment and weaker demand for dental care. In recent years, producers benefited from employment levels moving toward pre-pandemic levels and rising health expenditure, although elevated inflation and growing uncertainty in 2024 have led to further revenue losses. Manufacturers have been negatively impacted by significant supply chain disruptions in recent years, which, combined with volatile input prices, have contributed to rising purchase costs. Higher purchase costs and weaker demand for mouthwashes have placed downward pressure on profit. As a result, revenue is set to weaken at an estimated CAGR of 2.4% to $2.5 billion through the end of 2024, including a 0.4% dip that year alone.",
