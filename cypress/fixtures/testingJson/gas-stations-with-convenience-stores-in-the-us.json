    "executive_summary": "Over the past five years, the Gas Stations with Convenience Stores industry has faced significant challenges because of fluctuating fuel prices, substantially influenced by global events like the COVID-19 pandemic, supply chain disruptions and geopolitical unrest. These fluctuations led to challenges in striking a balance between maximizing profit and maintaining competitive retail prices. Also, growing consumer inclination toward fuel-efficient and electric vehicles has begun to influence industry dynamics, posing a threat to retail gasoline sales. However, the industry showed resilience by shifting its focus to a more stable and predictable revenue source of convenience store sales. Industry operators expanded their product lines, spurred by an increase in overall consumer spending. Many gas stations transitioned from mere fuel stops to comprehensive service.",
