Industry products are crucial to the construction and mining sectors, as the value of these industries are hard to access without large machinery. Demand for the construction and mining industries directly increases the demand for industry products. Over the past five years, revenue has grown at a CAGR of 1.1% to $123.4 billion, including an expected 1.0% increase in 2023. Profit is expected to slump to 5.0% of revenue in 2023 from 5.2% in 2018.",

Most construction projects require the purchase of tractors, graders, rollers and other equipment from wholesalers. The pandemic caused a massive drop in consumer confidence due to the high uncertainty regarding the economic future. This temporarily discouraged consumers from spending. Decreased consumer spending on tourism and social activities during the pandemic left extra income for home improvement projects. A spike in home improvements helped limit industry declines in 2020. The rise in demand for mining contributed to industry revenue gains as mining accounts for a significant market for operators. The mining sector requires industry products to extract minerals like coal, ores and crude petroleum."
