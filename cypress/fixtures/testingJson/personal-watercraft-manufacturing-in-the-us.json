Personal watercrafts are highly discretionary purchases, with demand flowing in line with trends in discretionary income and consumer confidence. The industry grew steadily during heady economic times prior to the outbreak of COVID-19 and boomed throughout the pandemic as consumer spending rose, interest rates dropped to record-low levels and consumers found themselves with more leisure time as a result of pandemic-era restrictions.",

The pandemic increased interest in outdoor activities, including water-based recreation. The sea and other bodies of water largely remained free to use while most leisure activities shut down. As a result, many Americans took to the outdoors during the peak of the pandemic, driving sales for personal watercraft."

As a nonessential purchase, sales have dipped consumers opt to save money where they can. More directly, efforts to combat inflation have also decreased export sales. While rising interest rates have slowed inflation, they have simultaneously strengthened the US dollar. As a result, American-made products have become more expensive abroad."

The top two destinations for industry exports are Canada and Mexico, owing to the close proximity of these countries to the United States and reduced trade barriers under the North American Free Trade Agreement. Moreover, the industry's largest players remain well-recognized foreign brands."
