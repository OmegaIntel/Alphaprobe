    "executive_summary": "Shaky economic conditions and the continued acceleration of direct competition have significantly impacted consumer lawyers and attorneys in the United States. The effects of the pandemic, coupled with rising interest rates, significantly impacted two core revenue niches: consumer interest and business growth, as this constrained consumers' abilities to shop online more frequently and shrunk the potential litigation market due to a smaller number of businesses forming. While federal agencies and regulations continue to play a significant role in enhancing consumer protections and bolstering the ability of customers to pursue litigation, recent volatility in disposable income among consumers has constrained this possibility.\n\nNonetheless, the rapid digitization and expansion of online shopping services have opened the marketplace to a greater chance of online scams or false advertising. Over the past five years, revenue fell at a CAGR of 1.1% to an estimated $37.2 billion, while profit remained relatively stable due to continued cost-cutting measures and a push toward online consultations.\n\nAlthough consumer lawyers and attorneys specialize in one legal niche, the wide array of consumer protection laws, which tackle a variety of business sectors, ensures the industry's broad popularity nationwide. The rapid expansion of digital services, both for consumers looking to purchase something online and lawyers looking to conduct a consultation or process data digitally, has provided a net benefit for operators, especially as competition continues to heat up amid different lawyer specializations and the rapid advancement of digital consulting services provides consumers with a potential low-cost legal consulting option.\n\nAs the economy recovers via business and disposable income growth and the prevalence of online fakes and digital scams becomes more mainstream, consumer lawyers and attorneys will have their work cut out for them. Artificial intelligence (AI) will open the legal market to even more complex business scams that can impact consumers even of younger ages; nonetheless, it will also be a beneficial tool for lawyers looking to save on operational expenses and improve their workflow. Over the next five years, revenue is expected to grow at a CAGR of 2.2% to an estimated $41.4 billion.",

            "current_performance_point_description": "Consumer lawyers are highly dependent on stable macroeconomic conditions to turn a profit, particularly within the business sector. Recent volatility in the number of businesses post-pandemic, coupled with higher inflation that ate into consumers' disposable incomes, limited downstream customers' ability to pursue a full litigation case. With labor costs continuing to accelerate during this period, many consumer lawyers have been pushed to specialize in specific legal practices within consumer law."

The embrace of virtual consultation meetings has enabled operators to improve their efficiency in dealing with clients, while a push to advertise digitally via mediums such as Instagram and TikTok has expanded consumer lawyers' visibility."

It strengthens existing operational requirements for online businesses.
