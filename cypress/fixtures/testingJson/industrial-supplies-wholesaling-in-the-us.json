    "executive_summary": "Industrial supplies wholesalers sell a range of general-use supplies, including boxes and crates, packaging material, adhesives, abrasives, ropes, industrial hoses, valves and power transmission supplies. A range of customers, from auto mechanics to teams repairing and maintaining industrial facilities, use industrial supplies and turn to wholesalers to purchase these supplies. The downstream market also includes consumer beverage producers that purchase bottles and containers from the industry. In 2020, the volatile economic conditions during the pandemic hindered industry performance. The ensuing economic recovery supercharged demand for industrial supplies, supporting strong industry expansion. Industrial supplies wholesaling revenue is forecast to increase at a CAGR of 2.7% to $111.7 billion through the end of 2024, with growth of 0.5% estimated for the current year.",

Slow manufacturing growth amid the pandemic has tempered revenue growth. A recovery in 2021 amid improving macroeconomic conditions boosted the industry, as industrial production and corporate profit surged. Gains in 2021 were primarily offset by subsequent demand declines from primary metal manufacturers along with skyrocketing interest rates that dissuaded industry investment, damaging revenue. The adverse effects of waning corporate profit are further exacerbated by an appreciating dollar blighting demand for domestic products."

The pandemic significantly hindered industrial supplies wholesaler profit, as business disruptions and depleted demand crippled companies. To combat this, large enterprises have turned to source inputs globally, minimizing expenses and bolstering their profit."

While this reduced demand for industrial supplies, the industry was supported by companies demanding supplies and equipment needed to manufacture ventilators and other medical equipment. Many hospitals experienced a shortage of ventilators, so some manufacturers temporarily converted their facilities to produce these medical devices. To do this, these manufacturers needed parts from industrial supplies wholesalers, this demand helped shield the industry from suffering the full brunt of the economic downturn in 2020."
