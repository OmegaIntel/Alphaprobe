    "executive_summary": "The Boxing Promoters industry has experienced robust growth for most of the five years to 2022, before being hit by the COVID-19 (coronavirus) outbreak. In 2020, the government imposed the closure of nonessential businesses, leading to the mass cancelation and postponement of many sports events, including boxing matches. However, the distribution of vaccines and the resumption of social events in 2021 have helped industry operators to recover most of the losses in 2021. Moreover, during the current period, two highest-grossing fights in boxing history took place, renewing interest in the sport itself and expanding revenue. Overall, IBISWorld estimates that industry revenue has increased at an annualized rate of 2.2% to $438.6 million over the five years to 2022, including an anticipated increase of 1.8% in 2022 alone.",
