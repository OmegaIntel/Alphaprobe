Industry participants include owner-lessors of nonresidential buildings, establishments that rent real estate and then act as lessors in subleasing it, and establishments that provide full-service office space. Over the five years to 2024, lessors have experienced mixed demand from critical downstream market segments. Since the onset of COVID-19, demand for office space has plunged amid work-from-home and hybrid work arrangements. However, demand for industrial and retail spaces has risen, buoying industry revenue. Over the past five years, industry revenue has risen at a CAGR of 0.1% to reach $257.7 billion, despite an estimated 1.2% decline in 2024.",

The retail sector is expected to face challenges in 2023 due to e-commerce reducing foot traffic. The industrial sector is expected to continue growing due to demand for warehouse space from e-commerce. Rising interest rates can lead to lower property values, making it harder to refinance leases or sell properties. For most of the current period, low interest rates stimulated business expansion, but the Federal Reserve began raising rates in 2022 to combat inflation, resulting in higher borrowing costs and declining demand."
