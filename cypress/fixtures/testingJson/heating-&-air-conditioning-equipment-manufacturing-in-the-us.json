By the outset of 2022, interest rates were at historic lows and residential demand boomed. Aided by historically low interest rates, housing starts, which measure the number of new, privately owned housing units built, increased rapidly in the years following the pandemic's start. Consistent growth in disposable income has also made consumers more willing to spend on remodeling projects, including the replacement of air conditioners and heaters."

Imported HVACR products have increased, while industry exports have declined over the past five years. This trade gap has also been exacerbated by an appreciation of the US dollar, which makes industry exports relatively more expensive and less attractive to buyers overseas. Lower-cost imports have prevented domestic manufacturers from expanding profit."

Like exported goods, imports will flow from existing plants in Mexico and Canada as a result of their proximity and free trade benefits. Mexico alone accounts for nearly a third of all imports. However, the lower labor costs in countries like Mexico will also encourage imports from countries where labor costs are even lower, like China. HVACR products manufactured in China have already grown to account for nearly a third of all imported industry products.
