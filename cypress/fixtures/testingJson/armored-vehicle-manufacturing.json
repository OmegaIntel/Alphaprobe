The Armored Vehicle Manufacturing industry experienced significant growth over the five years to 2021. Industry operators research, develop, manufacture, modify and repair military armored vehicles, including infantry fighting vehicles, armored personnel carriers, mine-resistant ambush protected (MRAP) vehicles, self-propelled artillery and armored utility vehicles. Prior to the five-year period, industry revenue declined dramatically as US spending on industry products fell. However, this trend reversed during the current five-year period as the United States began to increase defense spending and ramp up key industry programs. Consequently, industry revenue is expected to increase at an annualized rate of 10.2% to $4.6 billion over the five years to 2021, despite a decline of 12.4% in 2021.",

Prior to the current five-year period, industry revenue plunged as US military spending on industry products plummeted. However, during the current period, a pick-up in US defense spending and a ramp-up of key industry programs helped industry revenue to recover from earlier declines. Over the five years to 2021, industry revenue is estimated to rise an annualized 10.2% to $4.6 billion, despite a decline of 12.4% in 2021 alone."

The Department of Defense (DoD) not only purchases a majority of industry products but also establishes and funds the development of many new vehicles. Specifically, the DoD has invested billions into modernizing and upgrading its Bradley and Stryker armored vehicles. Moreover, the production of the new AMPV and the JLTV has created new industry revenue streams for years to come."

            "question": "Have export markets like Canada and Mexico offered an opportunity for your company?",
            "answer": "Exports has fallen sharply during the past five years, driven by a decline in export to Afghanistan and Saudi Arabia in the second half of the current period. Taiwan's share of industry exports has grown considerably during the past five years, driven by rising tensions with China."

        },
        {
            "question": "Do you have any challenges with customers paying on time?",
            "answer": "Since the US government is the industry's biggest customer, operators rarely have difficulty with late payments. However, recent budget uncertainty has made funding less predictable."

            "question": "How much time is invested in research and development? What are the associated costs?",
            "answer": "Research and development for armored vehicles is constantly evolving, and successful operators must continually improve upon vehicle features, specifications, safety requirements and other regulations mandated by the US armed forces."
        },
        {
            "question": "How do you hire workers? What is your training process like?",
            "answer": "Due to the technical complexity involved in manufacturing armored vehicles, highly skilled and specialized labor is necessary to remain competitive."

        {
            "question": "How closely do you track the trade-weighted index? How much of your business comes from international clients?",
            "answer": "A decreasing TWI leads to relatively less expensive exports and more expensive imports. Therefore, industry operators benefit from a weak US dollar through increased demand for exports as well as weaker import competition for the same goods."
        },
        {
            "question": "Do you have a reliable supplier of steel? How do you offset the effects of rising steel prices?",
            "answer": "Steel is one of the primary inputs in the production of armored vehicles. An increase in price for steel typically leads to higher revenue as there are few substitutes for armored vehicles, and demand doesn't change significantly even when the price of steel rises."
        },
        {
            "question": "What percentage of your business comes from government contracts? How has reduced federal defense spending influenced your revenue in recent years?",
            "answer": "The industry is highly sensitive to defense spending. More specifically, the amount set aside solely for the procurement and maintenance of armored vehicles is the most important driver of industry revenue. In 2021, US government contracts are expected to represent 81.7% of industry revenue."
