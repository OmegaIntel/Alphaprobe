    "executive_summary": "Figures have been adjusted for inflation and are presented in 2024 currency. Nutritionists' and dietitians' services growth and resilience amid the COVID-19 pandemic disruptions result from the industry's diversity of services and addressable markets. Even before the pandemic, there was a strong demand for these services driven by factors like rising obesity and the aging population. Adding to this increase in demand, consumers are increasingly interested in adopting healthy and sustainable eating habits. The rise in telemedicine has been an effective tool for meeting new demands and delivering services conveniently. Despite the pandemic's effect, structural features and demographic factors enabled services to grow and industry-wide revenue is expected to climb at a CAGR of 4.9% through 2024 to total $782.7 million in 2024. In the same year, revenue is expected to climb by an estimated 1.8%.",

To become a Registered Dietitian (RD), one must earn a bachelor's degree in nutrition or related fields, obtain multiple certifications and gather extensive clinical practice experience. Today's consumers have innovative alternatives like AI-powered apps, platforms and medically advanced wearables that collect, analyze, interact and support data. For businesses, these advancements may not necessarily replace their dedicated employees but could significantly reduce time commitments and help streamline their workforce."

Concerns over pesticide use and GMOs and a desire for more natural, nutrient-dense foods drive this trend.

The spike in the national unemployment rate caused many to lose employer-sponsored health insurance, initially subsidizing industry services. Increased unemployment resulted in more price-sensitive consumers, leading to a potential drop in revenue from voluntary consultations. Social distancing limitations further prevented nonessential consultations across healthcare. Despite a national decline in physician visits, many dietitian services continued remotely via phone or video conferencing, allowing revenue to bounce back and even surge post-pandemic."
