    "executive_summary": "Figures have been adjusted for inflation and are presented in 2024 currency.\n\nThe paint-your-own pottery studios industry has faced a challenging environment during the past five years due to the COVID-19 pandemic and changing demographics. Despite studios attempting to adapt with services such as take-home painting kits, the loss of revenue from group events like birthday parties and summer camps led to revenue falling at a CAGR of 0.7% to $22.5 million over the five years to 2024. Additionally, the decrease in the number of children aged nine and younger - a notable demographic for this industry - likely due to millennial parents having smaller families, created difficulties for industry growth.\n\nThe industry is now witnessing a recovery, boosted by rising consumer spending and reduced pandemic concerns. During the current year, revenue is forecast to decline 0.4% consumer confidence and spending on recreational activities weakens. As a response to the demographic changes and increased competition from newer types of studios such as paint-and-sip studios, the industry has taken steps to broaden its demographics by introducing more adult-focused events and services.\n\nLooking forward, the industry is expected to grow moderately, with revenue forecast to rise at a CAGR of 2.1% to $24.9 million over the five years to 2029. This growth is expected to be stimulated by the projected increase in the number of children aged nine and under, and a rise in per-capita disposable income over the next five years.",
