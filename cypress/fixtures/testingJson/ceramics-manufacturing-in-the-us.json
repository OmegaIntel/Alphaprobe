    "executive_summary": "The industry has experienced increased volatility during the current period due to fluctuations in demand from industrial and construction markets. Demand from the construction market is estimated to have declined during the period, which, however, was fully offset by growth in demand from the consumer market. Demand from the industrial market has remained largely unchanged. Volatility in interest and mortgage rates, as well as changes in consumer and business confidence during the period, have been the major drivers of changing demand and profit during the period. Additionally, pandemic-driven supply chain disruptions contributed to elevated price volatility for industry products. Overall, industry revenue is projected to stagnate during the period, with revenue remaining at slightly less than $3.0 billion.",

A decline in private nonresidential construction also contributed to lower industry revenue in 2020 although being largely offset by growth in residential construction which was fueled by historically low mortgage rates through 2021."
