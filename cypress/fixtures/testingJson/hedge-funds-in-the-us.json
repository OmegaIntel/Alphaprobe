Industry servicers invest capital they receive from a variety of investor types across a broad range of asset classes and investment strategies. Operators collect a fee for the amount of money they manage for these clients and a percentage of gains they are able to generate on invested assets. This business model helped industry revenue climb at a CAGR of 7.7% to $127.4 billion over the past five years, including an expected incline of 5.7% in 2024.",

These trends have affected the industry's structure, with the traditional 2.0 and 20.0 structure of a flat fee on total AUM and a right-to-earned profit deteriorating into a 1.4 and 16.0 arrangement. As a result, industry profit, measured as earnings before interest and taxes, has been hindered over the past five years."

Core assets held within the industry and the advantage of diversification enabled hedge funds to significantly grow revenue. In addition, an increase in access to credit exacerbated revenue gains as hedge funds were able to boost revenue gains with leverage."

Due to high inflation in the latter part of the period, hedge funds encountered economic volatility which put downward pressure on industry profit. Hedge fund managers have increasingly been concerned over the stability of the economy, with the conflict in Ukraine and global inflationary pressures exemplifying this concern among managers and investors alike."

By enhancing core risk protections, such as stress tests, the industry will be better positioned to adapt in times of economic hardship and maximize returns on its investments. These changes in risk management primarily benefit smaller and mid-sized hedge funds, particularly as larger hedge funds must allocate more capital for these types of programs relative to their size."

A recent push to eliminate the carried interest loophole by the federal government, which influences the tax rate for long-term investors, will influence the rate of investment among hedge funds. The continuous need to adhere to federal laws, such as the Dodd-Frank Act and Consumer Protection Act, ensures limits on hedge funds' investment capabilities and increases compliance costs for smaller managers."
