Rising per capita disposable income, increased government funding for Medicare and Medicaid and modest growth in the number of individuals with private health insurance bolstered reimbursements and payments to cardiologists. Also, the aging population and new demand from long COVID cases positively influenced the need for services. With public health campaigns (CDC) focused on heart health during the pandemic and after spurring awareness and advocating preventative measures, industry revenue is projected to grow at a CAGR of 1.3%, reaching $59.6 billion in 2024, with a slight gain of 0.1% in 2024 alone and profit anticipated to be 14.8% of revenue.",
