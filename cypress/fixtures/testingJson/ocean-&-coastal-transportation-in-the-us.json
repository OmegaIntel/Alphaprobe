    "executive_summary": "Figures have been adjusted for inflation and are presented in 2024 currency. Ocean and coastal transportation companies, including freight transporters and cruise lines, have had a very turbulent five years. A rebound in the economy has been spelling excellent news for the cruise sector as more consumers are back on the sea for vacations, generating more revenue. But, price shocks and geopolitical issues have raised the expense of doing business for the ocean freight market, impacting their freights and revenue. So, industry revenue decreased at a CAGR of 0.5% to $46.5 billion by the end of 2024, despite a boost of 2.7% in 2024 alone. The rollout of new types of ships, like ultra-large commercial vessels, has been helping add more boats to the mix. But costs remain a factor that many cannot avoid because of the high expenses associated with operating maritime vehicles. The addition of inflationary pressures has also been raising the bar, as ocean freights and cruises have been raising their prices to varying degrees of success. Freight transporters have been using the Jones Act monopoly to fare far better. Still, despite these efforts, profit has been going downhill because of how uncontrollable these factors have been recently. Rising consumer spending will help cruise lines earn more revenue through the next period. The trend of environmental sustainability will help uplift and modernize fleets of ships in the industry, helping add more competition while complying with regulatory barriers in the future. Geopolitical issues also will remain a factor that will cut into the industry's performance.",
