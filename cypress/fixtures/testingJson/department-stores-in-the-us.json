    "executive_summary": "The Department Stores industry has continued its long-term decline, with revenue falling. The industry's decline has been accentuated by an estimated 3.3% drop in 2020 alone because of COVID-19 but was aided by the economy reopening in 2021, which resulted in the revenue growing 1.4% in that year alone. However, with rising inflationary pressures in 2022 and 2023 and the continually increasing and competitive presence of e-commerce rivals, industry revenue is set to be more challenged in the current period.",
