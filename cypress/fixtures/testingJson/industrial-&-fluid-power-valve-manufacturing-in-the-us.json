This trend has led to decreased demand for domestically produced valves. The widening price differential between domestic and imported valves, coupled with the industry's struggle with flat industrial production, has put pressure on the industry's performance and revenue streams. Overall, industry revenue is projected to decline at a CAGR of 1.4% through 2024, including a 1.8% decline in 2024 alone, to reach $26.3 billion.",
