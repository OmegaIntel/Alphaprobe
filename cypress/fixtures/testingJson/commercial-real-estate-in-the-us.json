    "executive_summary": "The Commercial Real Estate industry comprises a diverse set of operators that specialize in a variety of real estate activities, including brokerage, property and facilities management, research and analytics, consulting, valuation, appraisal, construction and asset management. Changes within the commercial real estate market, including fluctuations in vacancy rates, property values and credit activity, influence demand for industry services. During periods of economic downturn, low business activity lessens demand for additional office buildings, retail centers, hotels, apartment buildings, manufacturing plants and other commercial spaces. As property owners and developers do not require new space, demand for commercial real estate falls.",

The rising value of private nonresidential construction translated to higher fees and overall performance for operators in the commercial real estate industry.

The closure of nonessential businesses at the height of the pandemic drove down revenue from commercial real estate. The shift to working from home, as evidenced by high office vacancy rates, has had a longer-term impact on commercial real estate than lockdown related business closures, as working from home seems to have been a more lasting cultural shift."

High interest rates have raised the cost of capital, driving down activity in the commercial real estate industry, which is often extremely capital intensive. Office rental vacancies are set to peak in 2023, indicating that demand for commercial real estate (particularly office space) has been dampened, aided by high interest rates."

Population growth underpins the growing value of commercial real estate as a larger population broadly creates more overall economic activity, including in the commercial real estate industry. US GDP has seen overall growth in recent years, indicating a broader base of economic activity on which the commercial real estate industry can build."

High interest rates have the two-fold effect of making capital needed for constructing and buying property more expensive and of making bonds a more attractive investment relative to real estate. Interest rates are expected to ultimately fall from their current heights over the coming years, though they are not expected to reach the lows seen in recent years. As interest rates eventually fall in the coming years, construction, transactions and investment activity in the commercial real estate industry should see growth."

While office rental vacancies are set to fall moving forward, they are expected to remain above pre-pandemic levels, as economic recovery and a return-to-office trend takes over the market. Many businesses have shifted to hybrid work, which could require a smaller footprint of commercial real estate, or to remote work, which, of course, requires none. Because of this, demand for specifically office space could see a permanent dampening in certain sectors of the economy."

Property managers will expand their service offerings to encompass more tenant-related services including facility management. The Property management industry (IBISWorld report 53131) is set to see overall growth in the coming years, supporting growth in the wider commercial real estate industry. As home price growth continues to outpace wage growth, residential real estate will continue to become less available to the average person, leading to a greater demand for rental housing and supporting the commercial real estate industry."

Eventually falling interest rates, a general shortage of housing, a growing population and overall economic growth will all be positive drivers for commercial real estate construction. The Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 will provide funding for construction projects meant to reduce the nation's greenhouse gas emissions. The 2022 CHIPS and Science Act provides for funding for domestically produced semiconductors, which will benefit the construction segment of the industry in coming years. Demand for industrial real estate is particularly important as demand for office space weakens."
