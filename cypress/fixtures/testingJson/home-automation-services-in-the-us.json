    "executive_summary": "Major smart appliance manufacturers build smart household cooking appliances, refrigerators and laundry equipment. Rising millennial home ownership and increasing disposable income in developed economies are poised to drive automated home demand. A boom in the number of internet connections has skyrocketed demand for industry products. High input prices provided new revenue streams for manufacturers during the recovery from COVID-19, as companies passed on high costs to consumers. Interest rates have soared in recent years, as the Federal Reserve has been combatting inflation. This has raised the cost of borrowing, reducing downstream demand from the housing market and hindered revenue.",

As internet connections continue to proliferate, more aspects of home life are automated, expanding companies' product portfolios and enabling them to tap into new markets. While the pandemic boosted demand for smart devices that reduce face-to-face exposure and boost safety, it also significantly disrupted the semiconductor chip supply. Industry enterprises depend on semiconductor chips as a key industry input, so inflated prices have pressured profitability."

Many consumers have increasingly adopted home automation services to make their homes more energy-efficient, convenient, and secure. Security features and internet connectivity have become essential in luxury homes, and higher-income markets represent the largest share of industry-wide revenue. While the industry has a strong foothold with younger demographics and struggles to catch up with retirees, a growing widespread acceptance and normalization of smart homes will benefit the industry going forward."

The widespread adoption of remote work has enabled the industry to leverage a steady stream of demand from home professionals, leading to demand for homes with pre-built automation services. Even as a renter's market has sapped demand away from new residential construction, the industry has adapted to cater to a Gen Z demographic who may find products less affordable, but are simultaneously better equipped to embrace the technology behind them."

As the recently passed CHIPS Act bolsters semiconductor chip manufacturing, industry enterprises will encounter greater profitability as they incur less strenuous input costs. Industry enterprises strategically invest in optimizing user experiences with advancements from smart lighting to increased security services. Major players will acquire small and local home automation providers to gain expertise and expand customer reach. Amplification in product offerings and geographical presence through collaborations and partnerships is slated to bolster the market share of the more prominent industry enterprises."
