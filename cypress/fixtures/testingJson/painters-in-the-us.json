When the economy fell apart in 2020, painting stood as one of the few in-person jobs without massive layoffs, owing to the industry's liberal use of personal protective equipment, respirators and ventilated workspaces. Construction crews experiencing similar conditions kept working as soon as restrictions allowed, cutting into a significant shortfall in residential properties and demanding paint services.",

Thousands of smaller paint contractors exited the industry, but unemployed entrepreneurs picked up the discarded brushes and got to work. Once the worst was over, paint supply caught back up with demand and the industry recovered almost completely by mid-2021."

Many painters used stores of respirators, masks, bodysuits, fans and other equipment to help medical response teams and protect employees. When these supplies ran out, painters either went without or halted operations. Upon the return of protective equipment supplies, painters in work outfits were protected from viral transmission, improving their appearance to clients."

Larger operators have also built tools for independent painters, including crew communication networks and lead generation apps. When the market for houses is thrown into chaos, painters spend more money locating contracts instead of on inputs, and the resulting contracts themselves are typically much smaller. Shocks in the Chinese market with the collapse of major developer Evergrande have further shaken confidence in housing, despite most of the bankrupt company's portfolio being located in China. Until this market corrects, painting demand will slowly decline and painters will have to wait out the storm."

            "question": "How does your company compete for contracts with larger businesses?",
            "answer": "Most large operators in the industry compete on the basis of quality, especially for lucrative contracts with large projects. These operators typically do not lack the capacity to deliver on more lucrative projects. Working as a subcontractor for a larger construction project may help smaller operators to break into more lucrative markets in commercial and industrial painting. However, the regulations and costs associated with these projects are also much higher."

            "question": "Have productivity issues ever kept your company from winning lucrative contracts over larger competitors?",
            "answer": "Lucrative contracts are typically awarded to larger contractors that have the resources to complete a quality job in a specific time for the right price. Larger contracts are more likely to go to companies that can demonstrate quality, communication and speed in addition to simply having enough labor. By focusing on quality, small teams might be able to beat larger, more inefficient contractors for projects."

            "answer": "Investment in new technology is usually fairly low among builders and contractors. If a firm's contracts typically involve painting or coating large, flat, outdoor areas, investing in a paint sprayer can dramatically improve project speed. Depreciation is very low in this industry. Therefore, any investments are likely to still be valuable in many years."
