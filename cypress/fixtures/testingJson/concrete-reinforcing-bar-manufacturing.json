    "executive_summary": "The Concrete Reinforcing Bar Manufacturing industry produces concrete reinforcing bars, also known as rebar, and bar joists. Industry products are made of steel and installed in concrete during pouring to increase its strength and prevent cracking; therefore, they are found in nearly all concrete structures. Over the five years to 2022, construction activity has declined, which led to decreased demand from the domestic market, with major declines primarily experienced in 2020 due to the COVID-19 (coronavirus) pandemic. In addition, although steel prices have increased over the past five years, its volatility has enabled operators to raise their selling prices. Decreased import penetration has slightly eased the high level of price-based competition in this industry. Overall, industry revenue has increased at an annualized rate of 5.7% to $17.9 billion over the five years to 2022, despite a decrease of 7.3% in 2022 alone, fueled in part by an expected steep decrease in steel prices.",

Additionally, the value of private nonresidential construction is expected to rise at an annualized rate of 1.8% during the same period.

These practices enable more established operators to reduce costs and improve profit, and enable big companies to acquire small ones. However, due to increased demand for industry products from downstream markets, the number of industry operators is forecast to increase, rising at an annualized rate of 1.5% to 1,381 companies over the five years to 2027."

In line with this trend, imports' share of demand is expected to decrease slightly, satisfying 5.5% of domestic demand in 2027, down from 5.6% in 2022. Although imports may influence the price of domestically made rebar, slower domestic demand and decreasing steel prices will likely have a negative effect. Furthermore, the US dollar is expected to depreciate slightly over the next five years, making imports more expensive for domestic customers and decreasing their pricing advantage over domestically produced products."
