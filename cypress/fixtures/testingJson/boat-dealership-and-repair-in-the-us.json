This has prompted individuals to spend more time on leisure and sports and increase their recreation expenditure.

But, even during periods of low disposable income and consumer sentiment, boat owners are more inclined to make repairs on boats rather than buy new vessels. The increase in boat usage has spurred demand for boat repair services over the past five years.

The industry may appeal to consumers with lower disposable income levels since repair services are included. Consumers with lower disposable income are more likely to opt for repair services rather than buying new boats."
