    "executive_summary": "The Medical Marijuana Dispensaries industry, which includes stores that retail medical marijuana by prescription only, has expanded dramatically. Medical marijuana is most used for pain control, typically to ease chronic pain. Marijuana can additionally be used to manage nausea, anxiety, and weight loss. The legalization of marijuana for medical purposes and the growing acceptance of marijuana use for medical purposes has provided enterprises and investors with unprecedented opportunities. As states increasingly pass legislation permitting the sale and use of medical marijuana, there has been no lack of demand. As a result, medical marijuana has become one of the fastest-growing industries in the US.",
