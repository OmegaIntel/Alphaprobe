Pet food and supply wholesalers have enjoyed climbing revenue as the popularity of owning animals as household companions continues to grow among different demographics. In 2023, the number of pets in the United States will reach 189.6 million. The increase in pet ownership has coincided with a growing tendency to treat pets as members of the family, which has encouraged consumers to buy higher-priced, premium pet food products that are marketed with special benefits, formulas or ingredients. The industry is expected to see total revenue rise at a CAGR of 2.4% to $19.8 billion over the five years to 2023, despite a contraction of 1.7% in 2023.",
