Online tools such as Google Docs, Ginger, Grammarly and Microsoft Word Spellcheck have encouraged businesses, individuals and other customers to forego using traditional editing services, hindering revenue. Poor economic conditions during COVID-19 discouraged the in-house production of editorial services, reducing external competition. Alternatively, sluggish growth inhibited demand for printing. These factors caused revenue to creep upward in 2020. As restrictions were relaxed during the pandemic recovery, consumer spending surged, causing corporate profit to rise. Companies used these increased funds to hire their own editors, causing revenue to plunge in 2021 and 2022.",

The internet has led to the rise of automatic editing tools such as Microsoft Word Spellcheck, which helps users ensure their documents have the correct spelling and grammar. Other tools such as Grammarly, Ginger and Google Docs help writers improve the tone, sentence structure and flow of a document. These tools have replaced editors' core functions, contributing to declining revenue during the current period as internet usage has grown."

Since consumers couldn't go to many of their favorite stores, corporate profit dropped. Lower corporate profit inhibited the creation of in-house editing teams and the use of artificial intelligence (AI)-assisted writing tools since they didn't have the funds to absorb the start-up costs, reducing external competition and aiding revenue growth. Alternatively, slow business activity reduced spending on printing, inhibiting downstream demand for the industry. Overall, revenue for editing companies crept upward in 2020."
