The industry's key downstream markets encountered supply chain disruptions on a large scale, as well as combatting plummeting crude oil prices and waning demand from US consumers and businesses.

Shipping lines purchased a majority of the global supply of containers, competing with lessors for equipment and reducing demand for industry services. Increased and intermodal shipping, which facilitates transportation between ship, truck and rail seamlessly, was growing in popularity at the start of the last five years. Due to significant increases in input costs, industry revenue has been falling at a CAGR of 1.2% over the past five years, and is expected to reach $351.6 million in 2023. As input prices stabilize and the value of world trade increases, industry revenue is anticipated to rise 0.9% in 2023."

At the start of the period, global trade was strong, particularly in 2018. As a result, the shipping sector encountered renewed demand. Operators struggled with rising costs, specifically when it came to steel. In 2021, the world price of steel increased at least 110.0%, and profit dropped accordingly. To combat overcapacity, shipping lines began to merge or join shipping alliances during the period, increasing coordination and reducing the number of containers required to meet demand by taking advantage of the availability of leasing options."

Changing market conditions and recent mergers have also disincentivized new prospective industry operators. Consolidation has become a significant trend among industry operators trying to maintain profitability and market share. A merger between TAL International Ltd. and Triton International Group in July 2016 created the world's largest lessor of intermodal containers, which is expected to control 28.1% of the global leased container capacity."
