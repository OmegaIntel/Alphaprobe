    "executive_summary": "Operators in the Handyman Service Franchises industry provide residential and commercial clients with a broad range of repair and maintenance services, spanning from painting projects and drywall repair to plumbing work and electrical system repairs. The industry derives most of its revenue from the residential sector, which includes homeowners and property managers. As a result, the industry expanded strongly over most of the five years to 2021, as the Construction sector (IBISWorld report 23) continued to improve. However, the outbreak of the COVID-19 (coronavirus) pandemic starting in 2020 has undermined the industry's otherwise steady growth.",

Based on data from the Case-Shiller U.S. National Home Price Index, home prices have increased an annualized 6.6% over the five years to 2021. This growth in home prices has encouraged homeowners to invest in home renovations and repairs to increase their property values."

With shutdowns across the United States in 2020 and a rise in economic uncertainty, unemployment levels spiked during the year, undercutting demand for the Handyman Service Franchises industry. As more Americans have lost their jobs and have been forced to work from home, more individuals have been able to undertake DIY projects, choosing to forego industry operators."

Notably, the federal government passed the Coronavirus Aid, Relief & Economic Security (CARES) Act, a $2.2 trillion stimulus bill in response to the pandemic, along with numerous additional stimulus measures that have continued into 2021. As a result, per capita disposable income has continued to grow despite the pandemic, increasing an annualized 2.2% over the five years to 2021."

Additionally, the Federal Reserve is expected to keep interest rates low throughout much of the next five years in an effort to ensure that the economy returns to robust growth faster than after the previous recession. This is projected to increase available capital for personal and commercial loans, making borrowing less expensive. In turn, industry demand will likely rise as more households and businesses can affordably finance major renovations."

As the number of renters has risen during the current period, property managers and owners have increasingly turned to industry operators to complete remodeling projects.

Since simple paint jobs are far less complex than plumbing or electrical work, this market segment has been negatively impacted by the popularity of DIY projects. Although this trend receded in more recent years, it was challenged at as a result of the COVID-19 (coronavirus) pandemic, which allowed home-bound Americans with additional opportunities to complete painting work.
