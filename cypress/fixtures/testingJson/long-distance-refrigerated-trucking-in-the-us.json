Sustained consumer spending on frozen foods, fruits, vegetables and meats insulated the industry from major trends and protected an essential lifeline during the COVID-19 pandemic. Still, refrigerated truckers' revenue slipped in 2020 as plummeting diesel prices pushed them to remove fuel surcharges. Meanwhile, the industry's landscape has become more fragmented as manageable barriers to entry have made room for a flood of new entrants.",
