    "executive_summary": "Figures have been adjusted for inflation and are presented in 2024 currency. Revenue for playground designers in the United States has been volatile during the current period because of COVID-19 and shifts in interest rates. During the pandemic, supply chain disruptions made it more difficult for designers to get the equipment they needed, while fear of the virus significantly reduced attendance in parks and recreation centers, constraining spending from this market. Despite these challenges, record-low interest rates made it easier for households to borrow money to make backyard playgrounds, so demand from homeowners caused revenue to soar in 2020. When the recovery took hold, playground equipment became more readily available and mass vaccination caused people to go back to parks and recreation centers, spurring investment in playground design services. The industry also benefited from growing school funding as the government pushed money into K-12 education as a response to the disruptions related to the pandemic. Rising interest rates have recently hindered demand from homeowners and have made equipment prices more expensive, hindering demand for designers. Overall, revenue for playground designers in the United States is expected to soar at a CAGR of 5.5% during the current period, reaching $80.3 million in 2024. This includes a 0.2% drop in that year.",

It became harder for playground equipment manufacturers to build their merchandise while operating under these rules, disrupting the industry's supply chain. The virus also made people more afraid to go to parks and recreation centers, constraining demand from a major buyer of the industry's services. Despite these challenges, record-low interest rates caused by the Federal Reserve's quantitative easing made it very inexpensive for households to borrow money for home improvements. As homeowners upgraded their properties, they spent significantly more on playground design services, causing revenue to soar in 2020."

Higher production increased demand for playground construction since equipment was more readily available, which spurred investment in the industry's services. Demand from schools was strong as legislation such as the American Rescue Plan (ARP) provided hundreds of billions of dollars for K-12 institutions as a response to COVID-19. High government subsidies encouraged schools to invest in playgrounds, increasing the need for designers. Mass vaccination made it more safe for people to go to parks and recreation centers, so attendance at these places soared. Playground construction grew at parks and recreation centers in response to rising downstream demand, boosting investment in the industry's services."

High GDP growth will spur demand for retail trade, manufacturing, wholesaling and other sectors. As revenue soars for many businesses, corporate profit will rise, causing many companies to raise their employees' wages. Per capita disposable income will rise as a result.

This will give schools the funds to invest in more playgrounds and pay more designers. Despite these developments, investment in the industry's services will be rocked by low school enrollment. As birth rates fall, the number of K-12 students will decline so that playground usage drops, encouraging some schools to cut investment in them despite higher school funding.
