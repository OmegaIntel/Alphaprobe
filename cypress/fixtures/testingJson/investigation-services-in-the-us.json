    "executive_summary": "Performance for investigation services has been on a slight downturn for most of the period through 2024. Even so, while the pandemic slightly reduced income, the aftermath provided a considerable bounce back which cushioned the slumps for the rest of the period. As the pandemic waned, many businesses reopened and were looking for new employees, bolstering the need for background checks, which remains the most popular service offered by investigators. Nonetheless, rising competition externally and internally has led some operators to record low profits, forcing them to exit the industry. Overall, revenue for investigation services is set to climb at a CAGR of 1.3% to $8.3 billion through 2024, including a 0.9% dip in 2024 alone.",
