    "executive_summary": "The Mall Carts and Kiosks industry, which includes a diverse range of specialty retail establishments in shopping malls, airports, sporting events and large department stores, has contended with difficult conditions. Declining mall traffic and rising external competition have threatened operators, which rely primarily on impulse purchases. Despite strong consumer spending and more aggressive tactics by shopping mall owners to earn revenue from underutilized spaces, the industry has struggled to maintain sales. Since 2020, the industry has been severely impacted by the pandemic outbreak. Overall, the cumulative effect of these trends is expected to result in a drop in sales. Revenue is expected to fall at a CAGR of 2.2% to $13.3 billion through the end of 2024, including growth of 2.4% in 2024.",

Falling mall traffic has been the biggest factor working against the industry. Mall carts and kiosks rely heavily on mall foot traffic to drive sales, as they cannot easily attract shoppers. Lower foot traffic in malls has reduced chances for impulse purchases from kiosks and carts within malls, especially as everyday staples such as toilet paper and cleaning supplies are increasingly being delivered to consumers' doorsteps from companies like Amazon.com Inc."

Most establishments were forced to shut down in response to mitigation efforts undertaken by governments and virus-weary consumers increasingly refrained from in-person shopping, limiting the foot traffic that industry mall carts and kiosks depend on. As consumers turned to online shopping, e-commerce sales grew more than 30.0% in 2020, contributing to a revenue decline of 27.4% in 2020. As the pandemic abated, revenue rebounded as consumers took to in-person shopping. In 2021 alone, revenue soared 24.6%."

These added services have provided additional revenue streams and have helped lift overall revenue. For example, numerous phone accessory kiosks have added phone repair and battery replacement services, while personal care product carts have added makeup and hair styling consultations. Since most anchor retail stores and online channels do not offer such services, carts and kiosks have attracted and retained loyal customers through these offerings."

This will benefit mall carts, which usually sell discretionary products based on impulse purchases. Establishments will continue to add service offerings to attract and retain consumers. Additional service offerings will also help operators compete with online retailers who cannot provide comparable services.

As large retailers battle for the consumer dollar, boost their web presence and invest in faster delivery systems, more retail spending will be made with a mouse click or the tap of a smartphone screen. Consumers' continued shift away from malls and other traditional brick-and-mortar establishments will diminish merchandise sales made by mall carts and kiosks.

Many landlords prefer this retail method because it minimizes the retailer's risk of going out of business. Compared with larger, store- and kiosk-occupying retailers, cart owners can often outlast their lease during adverse economic times. These operators have low overhead costs, lower inventory holding costs and fewer fees. Personal care and health products are the most popular products, followed by cell phone and accessory products. These goods are relatively inexpensive and favorable for impulse purchases.",

Mall proprietors charge more to lease kiosks and retailers often demand longer lease terms to account for higher expenses. Whereas mall cart leases tend to last months, kiosk leases can be leased for years, giving the retailer fewer opportunities to test the market before committing to the location. Kiosk operators often begin their operations as cart owners and upgrade to larger establishments once their business model proves profitable. Established businesses and chains are likely to lease mall kiosks rather than storefronts as they provide a semi-permanent structure with less overhead and high levels of flexibility.",
