Additional paper and paperboard products include: unprinted tags, table skirts, tickets and labels, draperies, fine crepe paper, other miscellaneous items. Other paper products include cigarette paper, coffee filters and cellulose insulation products. Tobacco consumption has trended downward over the past decade, but cigarettes typically fare well during economic downturns since consumers are under more pressure and use tobacco products as stress relievers. During the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, demand for cigarette papers increased. Unprocessed paper pulp products are articles of pulp that are not molded or pressed and are sold without further manufacturing or specification. These articles require minimal labor and as a result, have been less affected by competitively priced imports that benefit from lower labor costs.",
