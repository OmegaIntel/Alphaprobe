    "executive_summary": "The Officiant Services industry experienced turbulence over the five years to 2024, with its fortunes intricately tied to COVID-19's social and economic whiplash. Revenue decline in 2019 was marked by a fall in the number of marriages. 2020 witnessed a dramatic nosedive as lockdowns and social distancing measures brought weddings to a grinding halt, causing a significant revenue and service plunge for officiants. An ascent began in 2021, propelled by pent-up demand and the rise of intimate, outdoor ceremonies. As consumer confidence recovered, larger wedding celebrations have returned, driving a welcome upward trend in demand in 2022. Overall industry revenue has risen at a CAGR of 3.7%, reaching $813.3 million in 2024. Industry profit has also increased, as demand for personalized officiant services has benefited officiants.",
