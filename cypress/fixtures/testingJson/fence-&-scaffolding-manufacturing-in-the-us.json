As interest rates climbed in 2022 and 2023, manufacturers began facing declines in housing starts and private spending on home improvements, hindering growth. Stagnating interest rates in 2024 will ease consumer pressure, allowing the housing market to recover. This will stimulate the need for scaffolding in the residential construction market."

Still, while imports from China have fallen, imports from India have surged, posing a potential threat to manufacturers. The strengthening of the US dollar in recent years has reduced export growth, subduing manufacturers' performance.
