    "executive_summary": "Animal shelters have faced significant financial strain in recent years resulting from pandemic-induced economic downturns and rising interest rates. The shelters, primarily operating as nonprofits, have seen a drop in donations as corporate profits dwindled and businesses cut back on spending. The financial pressures were compounded as government funding, though essential, remained competitive and often insufficient to meet rising operational costs. Despite these challenges, shelters did see a pandemic boom, where adoptions were up, albeit with tightened budgets and reduced resources. Aided by government stimulus, industry revenue is expected to push up at a CAGR of 2.8% to reach $3.5 billion through 2024, with stagnant growth in 2024 and profit at 2.4%.",

This community support has been vital, helping shelters to offset some operational costs. Also, the growing societal push for humane animal treatment has seen a marked preference for no-kill policies.

Economic conditions, however, remain a critical factor. Urban areas, particularly high-cost metropolitan regions with higher disposable incomes, will see more robust adoption rates and pet spending. Despite the growth potential, shelters must strategically leverage volunteers and secure donations to sustain operations."

Because funding is sourced from several different entities, the pandemic significantly disrupted shelter operations. For example, in 2020, declining corporate profit led to dwindling contributions and donations to animal shelters. As the economy faced further disruptions in 2022 following rising interest rates, businesses reeled in spending, which diminished shelter funding."
