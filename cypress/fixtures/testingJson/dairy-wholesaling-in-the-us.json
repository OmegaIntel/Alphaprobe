    "executive_summary": "Dairy wholesalers have enjoyed stable revenue growth over most of the five years to 2023 as rising prices were accepted by a market with rising dairy consumption and disposable income. Still, because the industry's performance is heavily dependent on commodity prices and retailer practices, the growing trend of vertical integration between manufacturers and retailers has heightened competition between wholesalers and made it more difficult to enter the industry. Automation tech has lifted profit for wholesalers and opened new bases of competition, though, and strong demand has allowed revenue to rise an annualized 2.6% to $117.4 billion over the five years to 2023, despite a decline of 0.5% in 2023 alone.",

The price of dairy jumped twice through the period, rising 14.6% in 2019 and 16.8% in 2022. High dairy prices are beneficial to wholesalers as long as consumer demand is high enough to justify paying inflated prices at the grocery store. Consistently high prices will send consumers to substitutes and damage revenue, but increasing dairy consumption and rising per capita disposable income secured steady business through price increases."

New tech has boosted efficiency in production, storage and distribution processes, which has been especially crucial as wholesalers cope with volatile fuel costs. Profit is extremely low for wholesalers, so making use of all tech available to cut back on excess costs is essential to remaining viable."

Vegan-friendly substitutes like oat milk and almond milk have found massive acceptance among consumers and have fostered a reputation for being healthier and better for the environment than traditional dairy products. This competition has tempered growth and siphoned demand away from the industry."

This fall in consumption corresponds with growing concerns over the dairy industry's environmental impact and reputation as inhumane. Vegan-friendly substitutes will continue to siphon away demand from the dairy industry, which will lower sales for wholesalers."

Retailers and producers will continue skipping the middleman by connecting with each other to boost profit. Value-added services some wholesalers offer, like on-demand delivery, will be very important over the next five years in order to justify their place in the supply chain to retailers."

Wholesalers often have better relationships with other wholesalers than they do with some producers, so it makes sense for a wholesaler in the West to buy from a wholesaler in the Great Lakes instead of a producer. Wholesalers also need to keep a diverse inventory to meet last-minute needs, which results in backfilling product offerings by buying from other wholesalers. This step cuts down the already-slim margins even further, though, as adding another step in the supply chain can be severely limiting to what wholesalers profit from with each product.",

This system categorizes milk products into four classes that require milk wholesalers to report all milk receipts by end use. The FMMO then uses a formula to evaluate a price for each class, and milk wholesalers have to pay at least the weighted-average or blended price of all classes handled. Some regions, like California and much of the Northwest, have their own pricing regulations and don't follow the FMMO, and organic milk is priced much higher than the FMMO baseline."
