    "executive_summary": "General storage and warehousing have benefited from hikes in consumer spending, leading to more shipments of consumer goods and greater demand for warehouse space. Despite the economic environment proving much more challenging during COVID-19 in 2020, the industry experienced growth. E-commerce sales experienced a significant hike in 2020, leading to a substantial boost in revenue. However, the internalization of warehousing by large big-box retailers has tempered outsourcing demand. Nonetheless, both businesses' demand for warehouse space and their likelihood of contracting it from third-party providers have increased, benefiting the industry during the current period.",

In the retail sector, growing consolidation has led to the proliferation of big-box stores like Walmart and Target. These outlets have since internalized warehousing and distribution functions to lower intermediate costs, slash selling prices, and capture market share."

According to Prologis, products sold online take up three times the space in warehouses as those destined for traditional retailers. E-commerce consumption directly influenced a spike in rental fees and wages. Despite increased sales, this surge in overhead costs prevented an expansion in average industry profit and hindered any substantial growth."
