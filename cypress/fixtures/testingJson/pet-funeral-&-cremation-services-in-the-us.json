    "executive_summary": "The increasing cost of conventional burial services, especially in population centers with diminished cemetery space, has prompted consumers to consider lower-cost cremation. However, traditional burials still remain the most popular service offered. Additionally, households increasingly view their pets as an integral part of the family. This, combined with a rising pet ownership rate, has boosted demand for pet burial and cremation services. Overall, industry revenue increased at a CAGR of 12.5% to $1.3 billion over the past five years, including a 1.3% increase in 2024 alone. The jump in 2024 can be mainly attributed to the continued growth in the number of household pets throughout the past five years.",
