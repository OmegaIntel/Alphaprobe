Companies have competed with increased consumer health consciousness by introducing healthier prepared foods to appeal to health-conscious consumers, though these are more expensive. Industry revenue has grown at 1.9% annually over the past five years and is expected to total $39.4 billion in 2023. Domestic producers have adapted to health-conscious preferences but faced overseas competition, with profit falling to 3.2% in 2023. Growing health consciousness will limit growth unless businesses continue adapting to changing preferences. Industry revenue is forecast to grow at 0.8% annually through 2028 to $41.0 billion.",

        {
            "question": "How have international tariffs affected your ability to import and export products?",
            "answer": "Some industry goods are subject to varying tariff rates, depending on the production stage. Tariffs may significantly push up costs for producers, potentially leading to reduced profit, particularly for those heavily reliant on imported ingredients or exporting finished products. Producers may need to weaken their global supply chains and focus more on domestic sources because of international tariffs, adding an element of unpredictability to their operations."

            "question": "How does your company's profit compare with your main competitors'?",
            "answer": "Baking mix and prepared food producers endure varying profit levels, making a blanket comparison difficult. However, brand recognition, market reach and cost-efficiency strategies generally influence their profit."
        },
        {
            "question": "What kind of agreements do you have with suppliers?",
            "answer": "Baking mix and prepared food producers that can negotiate longer-term, fixed-price contracts have an advantage over those that can't, as input prices are volatile."
        },
        {
            "question": "Do you pass on your cost hikes, or do you retain the costs and take a loss on profit? How can you retain customers while also maintaining profit?",
            "answer": "Given the volatility of commodity and energy prices, successful producers can pass on unexpected cost increases to downstream buyers to maintain profitability. However, raising the price for downstream buyers may eventually cause a reduction in demand."
        },
        {
            "question": "How do you respond to variability in consumer demand? Are you ahead of consumer trends?",
            "answer": "Successful manufacturers can differentiate their products from the competition to maintain market share and boost sales volume."
        },
        {
            "question": "Do you have secure contracts with trustworthy suppliers? How do you prepare for fluctuations in input costs?",
            "answer": "Successful companies have contracts with suppliers of key raw materials to reduce supply volatility. Guaranteed supplies at fixed prices minimize supply costs and assist production planning."
        },
        {
            "question": "How do fluctuations in the US dollar impact your company? How do you expect to contend with a volatile trade-weighted index?",
            "answer": "As the dollar appreciates against other currencies, represented by an increasing TWI, baking mix and prepared food exports become more expensive in foreign markets. If the dollar depreciates, their costs of importing ingredients may expand, leading to higher production costs, yet their products become more competitive overseas. Producers may use hedging strategies to manage currency risk and consider sourcing raw materials domestically to limit exposure to currency fluctuations."
