Hospitals have met a high degree of fiscal uncertainty via to the whittling down of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA) from the prior administration, while a renewed focus on it by the Biden administration has already boosted the number of health-insured consumers, bolstering demand for hospital construction. From legislative hurdles to the global pandemic outbreak causing construction stoppages amid a surge in demand for hospital capacity, the industry has endured significant volatility.",

            "current_performance_point_description": "The industry has encountered various challenges, though none have been as problematic as healthcare reform legislation's uncertainty. There has been a shift from large, traditional hospitals to small local care centers for nonemergency situations. The pandemic outbreak disrupted industry operations due to local and state-mandated work stoppages and limited capacity for essential construction. As regulations eased in 2021 and macroeconomic conditions improved, the industry was rejuvenated amid surging health expenditure by the federal government, and the servicing of pent-up demand from 2020 enabled industry revenue to soar."

            "current_performance_point_description": "PPACA made healthcare systems more responsible for community wellness, raising hospital costs while limiting their revenue growth potential. The response from hospitals was to focus on cost reduction, which meant opting for renovation rather than new construction to improve efficiency at the lowest cost. An influx in out-patient centers has been detrimental to the industry, as not all out-patient clinics are tied to hospitals. The limitation in hospital capacity nationwide due to these market conditions led the nation to be woefully under capacity for the hospitalization needs associated with the pandemic. The emphasis on out-patient services has forced hospitals to reduce their capacity. Inpatient days and hospital admission have contracted faster than hospital employment and establishments. The decline in national hospital occupancy further highlights the mismatch in supply and demand. A surge in federal healthcare spending in response to the pandemic, with the need to expand hospital capacity becoming critical, has helped mitigate the negative influence of trending out-patient service."

The discrepancy has also paved the way for more merger and acquisition activity, which has further limited demand for new hospital construction. The largest companies are often general contractors, such as Turner Construction Company and McCarthy Holdings Inc, even so, these two prominent companies account for an insignificant share of total industry revenue, heightening the industry's fragmented nature. Industry profit, measured as earnings before interest and taxes, has declined primarily due to stiff operating conditions caused by the pandemic and a generally poor performance during 2020."

            "future_outlook_point_description": "Although new hospital construction will be driven by the gradual aging of the US population, effectively increasing demand for medical services, a more significant portion of this growth will go toward out-patient clinics. In the wake of the pandemic, the construction of excess hospital capacity and dedicated coronavirus wards are sure to be paramount, providing a much-needed revitalization to industry demand and revenue. Industry revenue will climb due to a surge in nonresidential construction activity, while total health expenditure continues to proliferate. Some positive highlights for the industry include focusing on ambulatory and out-patient facilities serving as hospital departments, which are more cost-effective. These facilities are a source of growth for industry enterprises, but also divert demand from new hospital construction, which are higher-value projects."

Though the Biden administration has worked to undo some of the deregulation conducted by the Trump administration, this still represents a vacillation on a clear path forward and industry enterprises might be hesitant at best to commit to long-term projects. While uncertainty still lingers, industry enterprises will continue to construct out-patient clinics and off-hospital campuses to reach a larger population share. Federal spending on dedicated COVID-19 wards is anticipated to aid industry performance."

            "future_outlook_point_description": "With a greater share of adults older than 65, demand for hospital services will rise. According to Architectural, Engineering and Construction Outlook, if the number of hospitals expands in line with the senior population over the next 20 years, an additional 2,000 hospitals and 340,000 hospital beds will likely be required. Hospital growth will likely lag behind the development of out-patient facilities, some of which are independently owned. According to the latest survey conducted by Health Facilities Management, hospitals surveyed said they planned to build more ambulatory and out-patient facilities rather than acute care hospitals soon. Due to improvements in healthcare technology, hospitals can treat more patients on an out-patient basis, which also tends to be more cost-effective. Future hospital construction will focus on providing smaller facilities and more multifunctional rooms to cut down on capital expenses. The cost to build out-patient facilities is far less than that to build hospitals. As demand for one rises, demand for the other wanes."
