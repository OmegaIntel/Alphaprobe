In spite of some negative trends during the period, the industry was able to ultimately see growth due to gains made prior to the COVID-19 (coronavirus) pandemic in 2020 due to improving technology driving demand for industry products. A combine harvester is a piece of farm machinery that performs the tasks of harvesting, threshing and cleaning field crops; end users include primarily those who harvest corn, soybeans, wheat, cotton and tobacco. While the industry has increased revenue over the five years to 2022, industry profitability is expected to weaken amid poor demand conditions and increased input costs including the cost of steel and industry wages.",

This index includes price increases in key downstream markets such as corn, wheat, and soybean production. These three agricultural markets account for a combined 93.4% of industry revenue in 2022, demonstrating how this industry is highly susceptible to swings in demand based on global supply and demand conditions in these commodities markets."

As a result, foreign manufacturers of combines have been able to sell industry goods at discounted prices relative to domestically produced goods, dampening industry exports. However, the impact of the pandemic on supply chains had a stronger effect on industry trade, causing both industry exports and imports to decline in 2020 for the first year of the period."

As agricultural prices are expected to fall slightly over the five years to 2027, this trend could slow or reverse, hurting demand for industry products. Moreover, rising interest rates will likely dissuade some farmers from taking on more debt should they need a new combine harvester, perhaps choosing instead to repair, hurting industry revenue."

This technology can also use computer software to measure crop yields more precisely and is expected to give US farmers an edge in an increasingly competitive global market for agricultural commodities. The integration of new technology into industry products is a critical selling point for farmers who do have the funds to purchase."

Much of the production line relies on computer technology and hydraulic robot equipment. For example, robots perform precision laser cutting and computer numeric control punching in the metal fabrication step. Painting is also done robotically, and an automated powder coating process paints a combine's parts before they are assembled. The role of human labor increases as a combine gets nearer to completion in its assembly. Workers directly perform the labor or operate the machinery needed for most welding, assembly, quality control and loading. As a result, human labor and oversight are increasingly important as combines grow in size and value along the line."
