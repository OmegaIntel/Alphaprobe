            "question": "Are your sales heavily dependent on any one market, major customer or other isolated revenue stream?",
            "answer": "Operators in this industry are heavily dependent on sales of petroleum and gasoline. The majority of sales are to other gasoline wholesalers, who specialize in last-mile delivery and comprise over 70.0% of revenue."
        },
        {
            "question": "How does the size of your company affect its profitability and growth potential?",
            "answer": "While the largest operators in this industry are generally the most profitable, during down years they are also generally the ones who fare the worst."
        },
        {
            "question": "How do you manage volatile demand that results from economic conditions or seasonality?",
            "answer": "Operators are directly effected by movement in oil prices and production. When oil prices increase operators generally garner higher revenue, when they fall the opposite occurs. The COVID-19 (coronavirus) crisis has caused great stress on operators. Both demand for industry products and the price of gasoline plummeted in response to the crisis, leading to steep declines in revenue."
        },
        {
            "question": "How are increased digitalization for businesses and the growing popularity of online shopping affecting your financial performance?",
            "answer": "As operators sell mostly to large industrial clients on a greater scale this has not necessarily effected sales directly. That said, increasing digitization has forced operators to provide platforms for clients to purchase industry goods online."
        },
        {
            "question": "How has your company been able to implement technology into the purchasing process to make buying more efficient for customers?",
            "answer": "Efficiency in the purchasing process is of paramount importance to those operators that would like to find success in this industry."

            "question": "How does your company ensure all relevant health and safety requirements are met?",
            "answer": "Keeping a minimum level of health and safety is of paramount importance to operators in this industry. If health and safety standards are not met, a company could potentially face fines."
        },
        {
            "question": "How does your company monitor potential changes to the regulatory environment?",
            "answer": "The regulatory environment for oil and gas has a significant effect on industry demand so operators must be weary of potential regulatory changes. The new presidential administration is expected to increase the level of regulation on the broader oil and gas industry, which will likely also impact downstream operators, such as industry operators."
        },
        {
            "question": "What immediate financial challenges are you likely to face in the next year?",
            "answer": "Potential volatility in the price of oil is a constant challenge that operators in this industry face. Additionally, companies in the industry have become unattractive given their involvement in fossil fuels, which will inevitably impact their ability to receive both equity and debt financing."

        {
            "question": "How has input price volatility affected your purchase costs and selling prices over the past five years?",
            "answer": "Falling prices during the period provided increased profits for operators but lowered revenue."
        },
        {
            "question": "How do you pass on cost increases to your customers?",
            "answer": "Since oil and gas costs fluctuate violently, it is imperative for distributors to be able to pass on any increases in the medium to long term to ensure profitability. That being said, overall demand for industry products can also fluctuate significantly. This dynamic has been demonstrated during the pandemic as total vehicle miles driven has plummeted, even though gas prices were low."
        },
        {
            "question": "Do you have long-term contracts with suppliers of key inputs? How do fluctuating input prices affect these contracts?",
            "answer": "Companies in the industry must ensure a supply of the products traded; the establishment of contracts with bulk terminals is advantageous."
        },
        {
            "question": "Do you have contacts across a range of markets? Are there any other markets you can expand into?",
            "answer": "Since direct selling is the major method adopted within this industry, it is imperative that sales staff have good contacts across a range of markets. The largest market for industry operators is wholesale resellers, who primarily specialize in last-mile logistics for industry products."
        },
        {
            "question": "How have volatile fuel prices affected your sales? How will you take advantage of an increase in the world price of crude oil?",
            "answer": "When crude oil prices rise, petroleum product prices also rise, fueling industry revenue growth. However, growth in crude oil prices also tends to raise industry purchase costs, negatively affecting profit margin. The COVID-19 (coronavirus) crisis has demonstrated the impacts of sharp price movements on the industry. At the beginning of the pandemic, prices plummeted, with the front-month contract even turning negative briefly. As a result of these swings, industry revenue collapsed in 2020, although it is expected to recover in 2021 and 2022."
        },
        {
            "question": "How will you plan for an increase in oil production? Do you have the capacity to handle increased energy usage?",
            "answer": "High levels of oil production result in a greater volume of petroleum product output, which directly bolsters demand for wholesale distribution services offered by industry operators. Since the start of the pandemic, oil production has fallen, but will likely expand as the crisis comes to an end."
        },
        {
            "question": "How do you ensure that your company complies with federal and local regulations? Have you had issues with compliance in the past?",
            "answer": "The complex nature of the products in this industry, their importance to the US economy and the potential environmental and safety impacts of spillage or improper blending of chemicals all mean that this industry deals with substantial federal and state regulation. The new presidential administration is expected to increase the level of regulations on the industry."
