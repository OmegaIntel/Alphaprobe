    "executive_summary": "Over most of the five years to 2022, the Car Wash and Auto Detailing Franchises industry has experienced steady growth. This industry includes franchised locations that clean, wax and wash automotive vehicles, in addition to others which offer self-service alternatives. During the period, rising per capita disposable income and a growing number of households earning more than $100,000 have resulted in more vehicles on the road, bolstering industry demand. However, the industry experienced downward pressure in 2020 due to challenges stemming from the COVID-19 (coronavirus) pandemic. The shelter-in-place orders and the closure of nonessential businesses kept cars off roads temporarily, reducing industry demand significantly. Demand has since recovered as restrictions have been lifted. As a result, industry revenue is estimated to increase at an annualized rate of 5.2% to $395.3 million over the five years to 2022, including an anticipated increase of 7.3% in 2022 alone.",
