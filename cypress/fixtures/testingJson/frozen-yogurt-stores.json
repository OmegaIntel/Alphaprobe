    "executive_summary": "The Frozen Yogurt Stores industry comprises establishments that primarily prepare or serve frozen yogurt and other frozen yogurt-based items, as well as toppings. Over the five years to 2021, the industry has experienced declining revenue due to lower demand for frozen yogurt and the industry's oversaturation. The popularity of frozen yogurt experienced a resurgence that began in 2005 when it was reintroduced by major player Pinkberry. It experienced explosive growth but has since begun to decline during the five-year period as other food fads such as gourmet donuts and freshly pressed juices have begun to take over. Over the five years to 2021, industry revenue is anticipated to decline an annualized 11.5% to $676.6 million. However, industry revenue is estimated to increase 2.3% in 2021 alone.",
