    "executive_summary": "Over the past five years, the Limousine and Town Car Services industry has contended with internal and external challenges. However, the industry has been helped by growing per capita disposable income, leading many consumers to spend on luxury car services rather than less-expensive alternatives. Moreover, new technology, particularly mobile apps such as Uber and Lyft that connect drivers and customers, has enabled greater ease of booking and paying for town cars and has provided the industry with a growing pool of customers. In 2020, falling domestic trips due to COVID-19 dampened industry demand from leisure clients, which account for more than one-third of industry revenue. As a result, industry revenue is expected to decline at an annualized rate of 7.0% to $4.7 billion over the five years to 2023, including an expected fall of 2.8% in 2023 alone.",

These new mobile transportation apps have facilitated more nonemployers to enter the industry with the promise of deciding how many hours to work and where to operate. Over the past five years, industry locations have fallen as more than one of every four nonemployers stopped driving in 2020."

Due to increased regulation and lawsuits over workers' compensation not covering chauffeurs, fewer contractors and more staff are employed directly by limousine fleet owners. Some contractors own their cars, while others lease vehicles on a short- or long-term basis from fleet companies."

These companies do not directly operate in the industry but rather connect drivers with customers. They have also enabled tens of thousands of new nonemployers to enter the industry to supply surging consumer demand."

            "current_performance_point_description": "Fuel is estimated to account for a notable share of a limousine or town car operator's revenue and industry profitability is hit by the volatility in fuel prices over the past five years. The fuel price at the pump is highly correlated with the world price of crude oil, which has exhibited a significant upward trend during the period. Most companies have implemented a fuel surcharge to protect their profit from excessive volatility in fuel prices; therefore, those that have not used"

Companies that do not pass on fuel surcharges, attempting to compete on price, expose themselves to swings in crude oil prices. In 2020, although fuel prices dropped, falling demand resulting from lower travel rates amid the pandemic weighed on industry profit significantly."

However, limousine safety has been a growing concern among policymakers in recent years. As the number of accidents caused by limousine crashes has increased, policymakers in New York have imposed a set of rules, including seat belt requirements, GPS requirements and commercial driver's license requirements for limousine companies starting February 2020. The newly imposed regulations have translated to higher compliance costs for companies in New York, reducing their profitability moving forward."

Travel rate, one of the industry's most important revenue drivers, is expected to improve over the next five years. Leisure travelers account for more than one-third of industry demand; improved business performance will lead to increased demand for limousine and town car services. On the consumer side, per capita disposable income will likely rise, meaning individuals will have access to more discretionary funds to spend on luxury services."

Vehicle fuel efficiency will improve as industry players upgrade their fleets, meaning high fuel prices will less threaten the industry. Traditionally popular vehicle models, such as the Ford Lincoln Town Car, are being discontinued, while electric models, such as the Tesla Model S, are becoming more popular among limousine and town car companies. Unlike gasoline, the industry has almost no control over the structural materials of its vehicles and must eat the higher vehicle prices. Therefore, an expected rise in vehicle costs in the outlook period will dampen industry profitability."

Many companies have already benefited from relationships with internet booking sites, such as Limos.com, which refers internet-based leads to limousine service providers and hailing smartphone apps. Cloud-based reservations systems, such as FastTrack, and software that enables companies to manage vehicle bookings, payroll and accounting have all helped them increase efficiency. Technology is also being added inside vehicles, including Wi-Fi, connected entertainment systems, device charging, personal climate control and more. As technology improves over the next five years, companies can focus on sales and client services rather than previously labor-intensive back-office functions while providing an even more luxury service."

            "question": "How has discretionary spending affected major consumers?",
            "answer": "When discretionary income is high, consumers are more likely to hire limo or town car services over just hailing a taxi cab. Moreover, when companies have more discretionary spending, they are more likely to use these services on business trips, bolstering demand."
