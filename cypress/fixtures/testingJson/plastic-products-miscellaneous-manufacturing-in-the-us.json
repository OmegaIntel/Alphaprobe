    "executive_summary": "Miscellaneous plastic product manufacturers rely on diverse downstream markets. For example, automotive manufacturers purchase various plastic components for vehicle interiors and engine units. In contrast, hardware and home improvement wholesalers buy construction materials, plumbing fixtures and plastic flooring, among other items, to sell to downstream customers, like contractors and consumers. Manufacturers endured global uncertainty and weak manufacturing needs during the COVID-19 pandemic, leading to sharp declines. However, production swiftly resumed in 2021 amid economic stimulus. While the industry faltered again in 2022 because of weak downstream demand, it has continued its upward climb. Revenue is expected to climb at a CAGR of 0.6% to $130.5 billion through the end of 2024, including an expected 0.9% hike in 2024 alone.",
