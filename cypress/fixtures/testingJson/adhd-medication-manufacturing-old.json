    "executive_summary": "Operators in the ADHD Medication Manufacturing industry manufacture medications that treat attention deficit disorder (ADD) and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). While this industry achieved consistent growth in recent decades, as diagnoses and prescription volumes increased, recent declines in ADHD drug spending have stifled revenue during the current period. While ADHD remains one of the most commonly diagnosed neurodevelopmental conditions for children in the United States, increased scrutiny on overprescribing have tapered industry-specific health spending. Additionally, increased competition in the form of generic medications and imported products have amplified decline in the domestic industry. Overall, IBISWorld expects total industry revenue to decrease at an annualized rate of 1.5% to $10.5 billion in 2022. Moreover, the prevalence of generic products has highly intensified price-based competition, constraining industry profit.",
