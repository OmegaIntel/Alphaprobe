Much of the complexities of the healthcare system were sidelined as the government struggled to contain the healthcare crisis and immediate aftermath. Revenue shrunk by 4.4% and 3.3% in 2021 and 2022 respectively amid a slump in healthcare expenditure and heightened inflation. Revenue is expected to fall at a CAGR of 1.4% through the end of 2024 to reach $6.9 billion, including an expected gain of 0.4% in 2024 alone. Profit is expected to have fallen to 20.6% of revenue in 2024, down from 21.3% in 2019.",
