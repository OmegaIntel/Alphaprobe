    "executive_summary": "Figures have been adjusted for inflation and are presented in 2022 currency. \n\nThe Antiseptic Manufacturing industry has expanded, albeit moderately, over the five years to 2022 due to heightened demand from the industry's key markets, including healthcare and household consumers. During the five-year period, demand for antiseptics has increased alongside rising total health expenditure, largely fueled by the expanding medical needs of an aging US population. While the outbreak of the COVID-19 (coronavirus) caused healthcare systems to divert resources into pandemic management and defer surgical procedures, reducing demand for some industry products, diversification in the industry's products and end markets shielded it from a stronger decline. Following vaccine availability in 2021, a recovery in total health expenditure fueled by pent-up demand for elective procedures has supported revenue growth. Although the industry remains susceptible to risks related to new variants, vaccination rates, and supply chain logistics, industry revenue is expected to increase, rising an annualized 0.7% to $1.1 billion over the five years to 2022, including an increase of 2.9% in 2022 alone.",

During most of the period, demand for healthcare-related antiseptic products grew appreciably as an aging US population led to rising doctor visits. Additionally, spending on consumer antiseptics has improved over the past five years as rising employment and disposable income levels have prompted health-conscious consumers to spend more on personal antiseptic products, which are considered discretionary purchases by most households."

            "current_performance_point_description": "While domestic demand for antiseptics has steadily expanded over the five years to 2022, import penetration into the industry has risen as well. Increased import penetration can generally be explained by an appreciating US dollar, which makes domestically produced goods more expensive relative to their foreign counterparts, and rising competition from lower-cost alternatives available from manufacturers overseas that benefit from lower labor costs. For instance, imports accounted for 42.9% of domestic demand in 2020, compared with 41.6% in 2022, as the US dollar appreciated as investors sought out safe haven currencies amid global economic uncertainty."

Since antiseptics are used on humans, all categories of antiseptics are regulated by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). To bring an antiseptic to market, its manufacturer has two options, the new drug application process or the over-the-counter (OTC) drug review. Most antiseptic products are currently being marketed as OTC healthcare antiseptic drug products. In recent years, the FDA has issued warnings to antiseptic manufacturers with regard to both the safety and efficacy of their products."

Overall, the number of industry enterprises is expected to rise at an annualized rate of 2.5% to 186 companies over the five years to 2027.
