    "executive_summary": "Contract Research Organizations (CROs) have performed well during the current period, but revenue has been volatile. Revenue soared in 2020 as high demand for COVID-19 vaccines, treatments and drugs spurred investment in CROs. The industry has suffered in recent years, however, as higher interest rates have made it more expensive for pharmaceutical companies and other businesses to engage in research and development (R&D). High clinical trial costs and an uptick in patent expirations have driven pharmaceutical companies to outsource the management of clinical trials, boosting downstream demand for operators' services. Overall, revenue for CROs is anticipated to creep upward at a CAGR of 1.3% during the current period, reaching $20.8 billion in 2024 and including a 2.4% jump in revenue in that year.",

This hindered consumer spending and reduced corporate profit. Lower corporate profit gave businesses fewer funds for research and development (R&D), harming downstream demand for CROs' services. Despite this, contract research organizations greatly benefited from massive investments in new drugs and treatments because of the virus."

These trials provide a lower cost and more efficient means for contract research organizations to conduct trials, though some variables may be more difficult to control. Decentralized trials are more labor-intensive, but this hasn't been a serious concern for CROs since employment has been increasing during the current period."

Contract research organizations (CROs) promise greater efficiency and lower costs, making them more attractive for companies willing to outsource trial management. Research investment has ticked up in response to drug patent expirations, motivating pharmaceutical companies to outsource research and fill revenue gaps."
