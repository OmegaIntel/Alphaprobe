The top artists are the ones whose work is highly coveted and revered, and famous authors and actors are capable of earning millions of dollars annually. Favorable economic conditions persisted for the majority of the five years to 2023, but the outbreak of COVID-19 stifled industry activity in 2020 significantly. Revenue ultimately grew at a CAGR of 0.7% to $57.4 billion in 2024, including a growth of 0.8% that year alone.",
