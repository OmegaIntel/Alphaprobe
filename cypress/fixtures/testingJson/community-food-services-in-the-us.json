    "executive_summary": "The COVID-19 pandemic posed major challenges to community food services, prompting significant government aid and innovation in delivery methods within this sector to ensure safe and efficient food distribution. Due to the economic upheaval, millions called upon community food services, many for the first time. In response, government expenditure on social services nearly doubled to meet the increased unemployment and poverty of the pandemic. The Families First Coronavirus Response Act allocated $400.0 million in funding to local food banks through the Emergency Food Assistance Program (TEFAP). Per capita disposable income growth helped some individuals transition out of food insecurity. The pandemic also triggered the development of creative strategies for service delivery (temporary food banks in parking lots, online ordering systems and drive-through distribution).",

At the same time, the industry adapted to pandemic conditions by implementing novel delivery methods, including drive-through pick-up points and contactless delivery (e.g., through pick-up points). Despite performance slowdown post-pandemic and significant revenue volatility through the period, industry revenue grew at a CAGR of 10.7% through 2023, with revenue expected to strengthen 3.0% and reach $25.1 billion in 2024."
