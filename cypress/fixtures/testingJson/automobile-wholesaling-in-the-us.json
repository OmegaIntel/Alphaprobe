    "executive_summary": "Automobile wholesalers consist of merchant distributors of new and used automobiles, light trucks, SUVs, heavy trucks, motorcycles, trailers, buses and motor homes. Motor vehicle parts or tire sellers are not included in this industry. Along with the broader automotive sector, wholesalers have endured volatile supply chains and economic conditions. During the pandemic, new car sales plummeted and people traveled less, contributing to weak revenue growth. Despite poor consumer markets, torrid growth across shipping and e-commerce industries stimulated demand for larger cargo vehicles. Overall, revenue strengthened at an expected CAGR of 0.1% to $823.3 billion through the current period, including a 0.7% increase in 2024, where profit fell to 3.2%. Growth will hasten through the outlook period. Strengthening economic conditions, highlighted by per capita disposable income growth and more positive consumer sentiment, will encourage consumers to spend more. This trend will lead to more new car purchases and push consumers to trade up to more expensive vehicles. Changing environmental standards and government support will also change the automotive landscape. The rollout and adoption of electric vehicles will force wholesalers to update inventories to appeal to consumer preferences. Rebates and tax breaks on more fuel-efficient cars will make them more popular. Overall, revenue will climb at an expected CAGR of 1.6% to $889.4 billion through the outlook period, where profit will reach 3.2%",

            "current_performance_point_description": "The automotive supply chain struggled in 2020 during the pandemic. Economic uncertainty and low consumer confidence deterred new and used car purchases despite near-zero interest rates. Fewer new car sales heavily contributed to limited demand. Similarly, stay-at-home orders discouraged most households from traveling, decreasing vehicle wear and tear. In general, consumers were less likely to travel and purchase new vehicles during the period."

            "current_performance_point_description": "Businesses represent a minor but vital demand source for automobile wholesalers. Business markets primarily include shipping and transportation companies that purchase medium and heavy-duty trucks. Skyrocketing e-commerce markets have necessitated more domestic and international shipping, encouraging trucking and shipping companies to upgrade and expand their existing vehicle fleets. The growth of the freight transportation services index has highlighted the enhanced need for trucks."

            "current_performance_point_description": "New car sales typically overshadow used car markets since new cars are significantly more profitable. However, amid skyrocketing new car prices in 2021 and 2022, limited new car supply encouraged households and consumers to shop for used rather than new cars. This trend led to sizable increases in the used car market and historic resale value. Successful wholesalers jumped on changing markets and added more used vehicles to inventories."

Wholesalers will stock more EVs and hybrids; these vehicles often cost more, potentially leading to higher purchasing costs and lower profit. However, various rebates and other programs may help wholesalers close the gap, aiding profit. The success of this transition largely depends on consumer preferences and EV charging availability."

For example, increasing public transportation funding will spur local government demand for buses. Spending for roadway improvements will also encourage driving activity, creating demand for automobile wholesalers. Similarly, the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA) has allocated funding for EVs. Specifically, the federal government has allocated significant funding toward charging infrastructure alongside tax breaks, rebates and other discounts for businesses and households purchasing electric vehicles."

Wholesalers will be able to better predict purchasing expenses and adapt accordingly. Similarly, lower crude oil prices will encourage consumers to drive more, increasing demand for new cars. Lower fuel prices may also encourage households to purchase larger cars, like SUVs and minivans, indirectly boosting revenue for wholesalers."
