        "Aluminum's popularity over steel stems from its lightweight and malleable nature, enhancing vehicle fuel efficiency. This metal reduces the overall weight of cars and airplanes, leading to lower fuel consumption and decreased emissions, offering economic and environmental benefits.",
        "Imports threaten domestic aluminum manufacturers significantly because high domestic prices drive downstream markets to seek more affordable options abroad. This situation persists even after the imposition of tariffs, as cost reduction remains a top priority for buyers.",
        "Aluminum sales are significantly influenced by the performance of the automotive and construction sectors, which are major metal consumers. A downturn in the automotive market reduced aluminum demand, negatively affecting manufacturers and causing financial challenges for the industry.",
        "As companies aim to produce lighter vehicle bodies, demand for aluminum is expected to surge. Automobile and aircraft manufacturers will increasingly favor aluminum over steel, recognizing its potential to enhance fuel efficiency and reduce greenhouse gas emissions.",
        "Novelis and Arconic have achieved substantial market share by providing a diverse range of high-quality products and ensuring timely deliveries. Their operations span multiple product lines catering to the construction and manufacturing industries, unlike smaller companies focusing on local and niche markets.",
        "Major manufacturers must adapt to increasing international competition by prioritizing innovation and efficiency. Successful companies emphasize maintaining strong relationships with existing clients and work diligently to secure favorable contracts, ensuring long-term stability and market presence.",
        "Protective tariffs benefit the aluminum manufacturing industry significantly. They help stabilize the market by reducing competition from cheaper foreign imports. These tariffs have been instrumental in maintaining domestic market share and ensuring the viability of US aluminum producers.",
        "The industry is subject to extensive environmental legislation overseen by the Environmental Protection Agency, which ensures compliance with pollution control measures. These regulations also mandate adherence to quality standards and enforce worker safety protocols, promoting a healthier and safer environment.",
